        As we nearing Christmas, we’re met with the familiar annual trickle of uplifting, heartwarming adverts that show just how wonderful your world will be if only you would buy your gifts from a particular retailer. After several weeks of this I’m already feeling bad for thinking our simple, paired down family Christmas experience might just not compare and wondering how anyone can’t help but feel any different after two months of constant commercial brainwashing.

        Over my time as a web developer, I’ve jumped between many frameworks and languages, attempting to find ones that work well for me. This seems to be pretty typical for developers who always have a take on the latest trend, either to quickly adopt or criticise it.
I really wanted to be a member of the Ruby crew for a time and ended up buying multiple copies of “Agile Web Development with Rails”, before having the opportunity to really apply it to a project and disposing of them because the material was outdated.

        I usually get one of two looks when I announce the name of my company as &ldquo;Nifty Digits&rdquo;. Either a “Ah, I like that” or a raised eyebrow. Generally, it’s the person latter in years who might raise an eyebrow.
When I picked the name, I was still a PhD student at University and wanted something that “sounded technical (digits), but also sort of British (nifty)”. I also was heavily influenced number of web design bloggers at the time, particularly Dan Cedarholm’s blog “Simple Bits”.

        All my most recent blog posts seem to be about updating my blog tooling (much as Rick commented earlier today). By recent, I obviously mean within the last 5 years.
I think I change blog platforms more often than I blog!
&mdash; Rick Hurst (@rickhurst) October 4, 2018 
I back tracked through my blog updates and discovered I&rsquo;ve used 5 different tools over my 15 year history on the web.

        As part of my past work with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I worked with the survey runner team to add additional features to their Electronic Questionnaire which enabled the business to take regular surveys electronically via the web. During my final months there, I took it upon myself to tackle what was seen to be one of the projects major pieces of technical debt, its use of a custom form renderer.

        As a freelancer who has worked with clients using non disclosure agreements in the past, it&rsquo;s often difficult to showcase or build a portfolio of my work. I&rsquo;m not alone on this, I know. Sarah Parmenter for one has posted about this problem as a designer.
As a developer, I sometimes feel it&rsquo;s impossible to easily show a concise representation of my work in a public arena anyway. How can I convey my role in what will usually be a complex process involving many other parties?

        I&rsquo;m switching blogging platforms once more. Moving from Wordpress to Jekyll enabled me to no longer deal with the multitude of updates and protected me hacks I could be susceptible to, but Jekyll being written in Ruby (a language I&rsquo;m not overly familiar with) has been a problem. I&rsquo;ve been able to cobble together scripts to deal with the custom parts of my blog build, but it&rsquo;s never felt like home.

        I recently discovered the library OpenImageIO, an awesome tool for reading and writing image files. What makes this of particular interest is the sheer variety of image files supported (BMP, Cineon, JPG, JPG-2000, GIF, DPX, OpenEXR, Targa, TIFF) (as well as variety of camera raw formats) and the fact it can perform image transformations upon them very easily. Given it&rsquo;s designed for use in media and VFX environments it sounds like it will be useful for the type of work I&rsquo;ve previously been involved with in stop motion.

        Recently, Andy Davies asked the following question on twitter:
Any ideas on how I can easily convert a video to a filmstrip?
&mdash; Andy Davies (@AndyDavies) July 23, 2014 
I found this pretty interesting, especially given I&rsquo;d used various open source tools for assembling storyboards in the past. I knew it was possible to extract images at desired intervals and left it as that.
After a bit of digging last night, I discovered it&rsquo;s actually possible to extract images based on changes in the video.

        Dates are one of those annoying things that shouldn&rsquo;t be, but are regularly difficult in web apps. I used the following two methods in a recent page to neatly break a date range into distinct segments as part of a analytics app I&rsquo;m currently working on. Hopefully someone else will find them helpful.
import datetime, calendar # Find the delta between two dates based on a desired number of ranges def datedelta(startdate, enddate, no_of_ranges): start_epoch = calendar.
