<h1><a href="/2014/04/07/copyright-law-finally-aligns-with-me">Copyright Law Finally Aligns with Me</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">07 Apr 2014</div>
<p>On June 1st 2014, some much needed changes are being made to exceptions to copyright law which amongst other things, will allow conversion of personal media between file formats.</p>

<p>Finally, we’ll able to make personal conversions of digital media (at least they will be now counted as legal copies). I’ve long made copies of my cd’s to listen to whilst coding (iTunes allows me to do so simply) – but it is not currently legal to move these files to another storage medium, such as an mp3 player. The fact is that most people have been ripping cds and copying them to iPods since it was technically possible, but music companies have never prosecuted anyone as the implications would stem far and wide and would the costs would too prohibitive to be able to enforce them.</p>

<p>It’s also not currently legal to rip movies to another format. So copying a dvd to a mkv file to play elsewhere is construed illegal. The fact movie studios put protection in place on their dvds to prevent you from doing so puts most people off doing so anyway. From June 1st this also changes so it will also be legal (but probably will be as difficult due to the copy protection in place). The guidance doesn’t specifically mention blu-rays by name, but it does say “The exception will apply to any copies you have bought, other than computer programs” – which I see to include blu-rays. However, it does also mention that copy protection may still be in place on those formats. Which you can raise a complaint to the secretary of state about if you think it’s too restrictive (good luck getting a response there!).</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of said changes, mainly due to the fact I own a huge amount of discs which aren’t currently allowed to be any format other than that they were distributed in. DVD’s, CD’s and Vinyl(!). I’ve found this frustrating, as my own stance is I should be able to manipulate the media to my hearts content within my own 4 walls. In fact, in order to listen to myself practicing when I used to dj, I need to make recordings which change their format. The fact that I’ll be able to do this within the law makes me a very happy chap indeed. Up until now, the law has been fairly grey on the matter, but hasn’t prosecuted anyone for format conversion (as far as I’m aware).</p>

<p>The new guidance is quick to point out that it’ll still be illegal to distribute the media you create – You have to “own” the media you’re converting. Therefore duplicating a friends mp3 collection at work from their hard drive will still be illegal. If you sell the original format from which you made copies, then your copies will again be illegal. Again this aligns with how I feel things should be done. I feel like I should be paying someone for the entertainment I enjoy from said media. The artist/record labels decide a price and that’s what I should pay – but I don’t feel like they can make me pay multiple times for the same thing, especially if I can create said formats from media I already own. If you hold a copy but haven’t paid for it, I feel it fair for it to be deemed illegal, however possible it is technically to achieve.</p>

<p>In summary, I feel these changes are great (but long overdue). </p>

<p>You can read a full summary of changes to consumers issued by the Intellectual Property Office <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/copyright-guidance-consumers.pdf">here</a>. Amusingly, the document explains you may be affected if you “read books, watch films or listen to music” – or my favourite “use electronic devices”. I guess that covers anyone reading this then.</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/23/shipping-in-march-weeks-2-3">Shipping in March: Weeks 2 &#038; 3</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">23 Mar 2014</div>
<p>So, anybody paying close attention may have noticed I’ve skipped a week on updating my progress on <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2014/03/03/shipping-in-march">shipping in March</a>. There wasn’t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my <a href="http://niftydigits.com">Nifty Digits</a> site. This hasn’t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month. I spent approximately 3 days on this, 1 on client work and 1 on working on <a href="http://hourglass.io">Hourglass</a>.</p>

<p>This past week however I’ve been working on a revamp for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and breaking out the shopping software I built for it into a new product. The reasoning for this is two-fold – we have stock for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> we want to rave about and sell and I spent a long time building a shopping cart system that’s only ever been used by me! It makes sense (at least to me) that making this byproduct available (as per the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products">37signals mantra</a>). <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> has existed for 7 years now and it’s backend has barely changed in that time and it’s still happily taking orders. This week has been an opportunity to rebuild it in a more robust manner, with more features and without everything that annoys me about current checkout systems.</p>

<p>Granted, it’s currently small and will probably won’t compare in terms of the number of features to cart provider’s that already exist – but what I hope it will provide is a simple, easy to manage way of selling stuff online. I’ve had a huge amount of thoughts on what would be the best way to package it, but have settled on a SaaS based system, rather than self hosted. I’ve been able to use stripe to simplify the way payments are taken and I’m planning on integrating a number of other tools to make life easier for developers.</p>

<p>Again, it’s incomplete and not ready to release – but it is in a place that I’m able to use it as an admin. I’m planning on getting <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">F&#038;B</a> using it and then releasing it on it’s own. If you’d like to see some features then please comment below and let me know. </p>

<p>The one thing I have realised about working on my own projects is the freedom I have to talk about it. No NDAs, no worry of treading on people’s toes, just (hopefully) helpful info. Several blog post ideas have been found over the course of the work I’ve been doing so far this month, one of which has already been published. I’m hoping I’ll finally have something to show you all before the end of this week.</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/10/shipping-in-march-week-1">Shipping in March: Week 1</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">10 Mar 2014</div>
<p>I promised a progress update on how my attempt to get 4 projects shipped this month was going. On my first week, I decided to focus on my time tracking tool, <a href="http://hourglass.io">hourglass</a>. I’ve had this in the works for sometime and unfortunately, it’s fallen by the wayside to client work.</p>

<p>I’ve failed on my first week in getting this released to the world, but I’m far happier with how it’s working now and the value it might give to any potential user than previously. I’d had a working app and a shiny new design for it prior to last week, so first on my agenda was to bring that in and start from there. Beyond that, I bug fixed a number of known issues, followed by building out a number of reporting features which I feel are critical to have before release. It’s also allowed me to better think about the decisions I’ve made regarding implementation and whether or not it makes sense to change them at any stage soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, over this time I hit a major hurdle of my internet connection being killed due to scheduled maintenance. I had been sent a letter on this, but hadn’t clocked the date. I was lucky that in Cardiff we have a number of excellent co-working facilities that allow me to turn up unannounced and fled home for the sanctuary of <a href="http://foundershub.co.uk">Foundershub</a>. In the end I lost probably a couple of hours to this problem and I’m glad I made the decision early on to move before I’d lost the best part of the day.</p>

<p>I’m going to be moving on to my next project this week as planned and move back to hourglass if time allows. I feel that experiencing the variety of these projects will hopefully allow me to continue some kind of momentum. Out of all the ones I have planned, I feel that hourglass is probably one of the larger ones too.</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/07/scaling-a-linear-domain-to-an-ordinal-range-with-d3">Scaling a Linear Domain to an Ordinal Range with d3</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">07 Mar 2014</div>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity of using <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> quite a lot over the past few months for a number of clients. It offers some amazing flexibility for chart generation and much more.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I’d share a quick tip I developed for mapping a linear set of values onto an ordinal scale. For those who’re seasoned pros at d3, this probably seems trivial, but had me stumped for some time today.</p>

<p>I’d picked out a colour palette I wanted to use for a particular graph, as per below:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">colours</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;#B8D0DE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#9FC2D6&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#86B4CF&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#73A2BD&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#6792AB&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The only examples I’ve seen similar to this are where it is assumed you want to vary darkness of colours based on value or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17321139/mapping-in-d3-ordinal-scales">vary the domain</a> based on the number of colours you want. Not a good fit.</p>

<p>I wanted to pick one of my values based on a linear value from my data set. My first thought was to make use of the ordinal scale function provided by d3. Something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">colour</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">d3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">scale</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ordinal</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">domain</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mySortedDataValues</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">colours</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In doing this, I got something that *looked* a bit like it was working, but not the way I expected. In fact, the way an ordinal scale works is that it provides a 1-to-1 mapping of domain values to the range, rather than any kind of interpolation between them. In this case, it was expecting only 5 distinct data values (to match up against the colours) and for everything over and above that, it wrapped them round to the beginning of the domain again. The solution then is fairly simple once you’ve got your head around that.</p>

<p>What I did next, was to create a scale that gave the index of the colour we were going to be mapping to. This works well, because the indices are linear and d3 has the ability to do the dirty work in that respect.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">colourIndex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">d3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">scale</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">linear</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">domain</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">d3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)])</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">range</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">colours</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span>

<span class="nx">svg</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selectAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;circle&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">enter</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;circle&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;fill&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">colours</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ceil</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">colourIndex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">))];</span>
   <span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Here we end up with an index ranging across all the indices of the colour array, and a colour appropriately selected from the palette as expected. You can see the resultant effect in the graph linked to below:</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/03/shipping-in-march">Shipping in March</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 Mar 2014</div>
<p>This month, I’ve decided to take some time out to ship projects. </p>

<p>I have a huge list of projects accumulating I’d like to push out of the door, but as a father and freelancer I have lack of a certain commodity in able to achieve them. That would be time.</p>

<p>Currently I don’t have any work booked in for a while, so along with Viv, we’ve decided I should try and get some of these projects released. </p>

<p>That sounds easy, but I’m well aware from past experience it isn’t. I don’t want to work outside of working hours (9-5.30pm) as I know the impact it has on my family. My hope is by setting myself some achievable goals I can at least get some way to ticking off some checkboxes on this growing todo list. </p>

<p>Some of these projects are products I’ve not yet completed, projects I’ve released but need work or ideas that haven’t made it to the build stage yet. As a freelancer, I hope that some of them may even help out other people in a similar situation to me.</p>

<p>Over the coming month, I’m going to attempt to ship at least 4 projects out of the door. 1 a week for 4 weeks. I’ll be blogging about my progress here, and posting summaries of how it went at the end of each week. The end date of the 28th is also my birthday, so it would be great present to myself to have come some way to meeting my goal.</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/10/27/setting-up-an-is-domain-with-isnic">Setting Up an .is Domain with ISNIC</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">27 Oct 2013</div>
<p>I’ve purchased a couple of .is straight from the Icelandic Domain Registry (ISNIC) in the past year with a view to using them with my own vps. The process of setting up nameservers isn’t great, given their somewhat confusing management interface. That’s summed up in a recent tweet below.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Looks like I just spent 39 euros on a domain I can’t use. Fucksticks.</p>&mdash; Craig Lockwood (@craiginwales) <a href="https://twitter.com/craiginwales/statuses/394167434196058112">October 26, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Given the potential savings compared to a ‘normal’ registrar, it’s likely you’ll want to make use of ISNIC themselves – who are much like an Icelandic version of Nominet.</p>

<p>Here’s the process I went through to configure my domain to make use of the nameservers provided by my (non-icelandic) host. The information provided <a href="http://web.peterhartree.co.uk/2012/how-to-register-an-icelandic-is-domain-name/">here</a> is a little misleading as it’s not necessary to use a “pre-approved” registrar according to the rules outlined <a href="https://www.isnic.is/en/host/req">here</a>. To be clear, there’s no need to use something like x.is, and you can point ISNIC directly to your hosts nameservers.</p>

<p>Once you’ve gone through the process of checking your domain is available and registering it, you’ll need to ensure your hosting provider has appropriate dns entries for your domain. If you’re using, cPanel or something that basically means adding it there. If you’re managing your own dns entries, add the appropriate entries within your manager.</p>

<p>Here’s the key bit. Now wait…. Seriously, for about 6 hours or so do something else. It will take some time for these dns changes to propagate and ISNIC to accept them. Basically these details need to be bounced up through the hierarchy of dns servers to the root dns servers that will respond to a request for your new domain, which takes time. In the olden days, I remember waiting days for this to happen.</p>

<p>Following that wait, head to the “redelegate” option within your new “My Page” area at ISNIC. Choose the “Not Registered” when asked for your ISP.</p>

<p>Go ahead and enter the nameservers you want to use. If the dns changes haven’t yet propagated, you’ll probably get the error “The nameserver ‘ns1.whatever.com’ has not been registered”, as shown below:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-23.57.26.png"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-23.57.26.png" alt="Misleading Error" width="676" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912" /></a></p>

<p>This is a pretty misleading error, given what it actually means is “your domain doesn’t seem to be registered yet on those nameservers”. So wait a bit more for propagation to occur…</p>

<p>Be aware of the <a href="https://www.isnic.is/en/host/req">rules</a> for ISNIC nameservers and check your host complies with them, otherwise you may find you encounter other errors. When the changes are picked up, you should finally be able to add the entries without getting an array of red boxes, much like below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-20.05.05.png"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-20.05.05.png" alt="Successful nameserver entry" width="684" height="577" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-913" /></a></p>

<h1><a href="/2013/08/14/a-decade-on-the-world-wide-web">A Decade on the World Wide Web</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2013</div>
<p>10 years ago today, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That’s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that’s quite a long time ago.</p>

<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 “weblog tool”</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>

<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed – I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently – which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>

<p>It’s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I’m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>

<p>Given it’s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I’m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it’s the moments I don’t share that are most important to me.</p>

<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/07/06/second-rate-britizens">Second Rate Britizens</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">06 Jul 2013</div>
<p>I decided to attempt a simple app this week, first using <a href="http://gocardless.com">GoCardless</a>, then later the <a href="http://stripe.com">beta of Stripe</a>. It requires the payment of funds between two individuals, neither of which might be a business. GoCardless suggests signing up to use their <a href="https://gocardless.com/docs/partner_guide">partner programme</a>, which involves registering a user as a merchant. This isn’t entirely suitable given the individual will be asked many queries on the nature of their business (which they don’t have). Stripe have a similar offering, known as <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">“Connect”</a> which asks similar questions. It’s at this point users would probably start turning away.</p>

<p>The recently announced <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/send-payouts-with-stripe">“Payouts”</a> from Stripe, seems like the most appropriate solution, but it doesn’t yet exist in the UK (and it’ll probably be a while before it does). Bigger players like Amazon’s fps require that you have a US card and haven’t ever made noises that they may be expanding into European markets.</p>

<p>As developers in the UK, we get a bit of a bum deal. Software products are often first targeted towards the biggest (US) market and we fine folks have to sit around and wait until the smaller pieces of the puzzle are picked up and put in place. Sucks to be us.</p>

<p>I’ve blogged in the past about the many payment providers cropping up and their services being unavailable in the UK. I can understand why this happens, but it’s frustrating not least because it hinders any momentum that might be able to be built at an earlier date. </p>

<p>I doubt I’ll ever have the same momentum as I did with my idea this week. It’s unlikely therefore, it will ever see the light of day. A US counterpart could easily offer an international version of my idea today.</p>

<p>I suffer from idea overload. It seems that every day I have an idea for something. As a developer, I’m lucky in that to be able to take an idea to inception very quickly. Best of all, I can show it at inception stage to a huge audience (if I had one), garner feedback and quickly iterate on that idea. To date, I’ve mainly created these by myself – a casualty of doing paid work in the main like this too. </p>

<p>Most of these ideas in the have been simple hacks – <a href="http://loveletterd.com">solutions to things that bug me</a>. <a href="http://fairandbare.com">One of them has been a proper business too</a>. I’m able to do something and make it happen, to potentially tap a huge audience. Get them to that first step. The problem I have is, not a single one of these so much as turns a profit, though they serve as wonderful educational devices for me. I would hazard a guess that some of them have indirectly got me work.</p>

<p>Some of my ideas never get past the domain registration phase before being knocked on the head. A friend many years ago gave me the great quote that ‘My domains are my todo list’. This totally hits the nail on the head for me – if I’ve felt like an idea was good enough to make it to the registration phase, there’s something there worth pursuing. Unfortunately, I have quite a long list to work through.</p>

<p>I heard it said that “The Developer Dream” is that we (developers) “build a product/service which we’re able to earn a living from”. But the majority of developers I know, don’t even begin to pursue the ideas they have. This surprises me. </p>

<p>There seems to be such an abundance of opportunities that I can’t imagine not building my own ideas, however bad they might seem to others. </p>

<p>Why hold back? Time? Yes, we have other commitments – family, work and maybe even a hobby or two. I’m not suggesting we make drastic sacrifices or sell our kids in order to create stuff. I’d would however, like to think that the payoff for building our ideas might make our initial holdups seem insignificant longer term. <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/05/03/if-you-build-it">I’ve said it before</a> and I can’t speak from as the voice of successful experience, but what do I get out of never trying?</p>

<div class="author_meta">03 Apr 2013</div>
<p>Whilst node.js heralded an era of being able to use a single language for both server and client side development, nobody mentioned the confusion such an approach could cause. It’s inevitable that there’s going to be similarities in code that constructs data on the server and that which presents it on the client. The fact that the two are written in the same language and the structure of them is so tightly coupled can make it easy to lose track of where you are and what you’re doing when knee deep in code.</p>

<p>Having primarily been using a full js stack (express on the server, backbone on the client) for side projects over the last year or so, I’ve certainly found myself tied up in this kind of knot. For example, if I’m looking at event.js, which represents an event on a calendar it could be the server event representation, used as an accessor for a db or a client side backbone model presenting the events attributes as part of a view. Usually (if you’re using a sensible class naming scheme) it is enough to know the file (.php or .js) within which you’re working and if that’s not enough, then the language syntax usually is a dead giveaway for where you are in your codebase. But this isn’t the case when working in one language. My guess is you’re going to have to take a second glance in order to figure out where you are, which isn’t a big issue, but is frustrating.</p>

<p>Currently my apps typically are structured like this:</p>

<p>server.js (Main node/express file)<br />
-lib (Classes for DB Calls)<br />
-node_modules (Node requires)<br />
-public (Client backbone app)<br />
    -css<br />
    -images<br />
    -js<br />
        -lib (Backbone and other dependencies)<br />
        -collections<br />
        -models<br />
        -templates<br />
        -views<br />
-routes (Contains the main express routes)</p>

<p>But I actually think the following is a better approach:</p>

<p>-server<br />
    server.js<br />
    -lib<br />
    -node_modules<br />
    -routes<br />
-client (Renamed from public)<br />
    -css<br />
    -images<br />
    -js<br />
        -lib<br />
        -collections<br />
        -models<br />
        -templates<br />
        -views</p>

<p>At least with the second approach, it is easier to have a clear idea of where to find classes on first opening them. Unfortunately, this doesn’t however solve my problem of moving between server side and client logic and pausing for a moment before realising I am where I need to work. This is a first world problem for which I don’t believe there is a solution.</p>
