        For the Christmas of 2021, I decided to make our Christmas tree lights incredibly complex so that I could marvel at my own animations running on them. That&rsquo;s tongue and cheek, but also ended up being very true.
I&rsquo;d been inspired by mathematician Matt Parker in 2020 where he did this. In this post I&rsquo;ll describe all the hardware I used and how it was connected and I&rsquo;ll share the code I needed to write to capture the LED&rsquo;s coordinates.

        I setup my Raspberry Pi using Bullseye and installed many of the same developer tools I use on my main dev machine for Python upon it. You can also check out a youtube video I&rsquo;ve made on setting it up here. I did this from scratch with a brand new install, with all available updates installed at the time. Bullseye is the most recent release of Raspberry Pi OS which came out earlier this month, based on Debian Bullseye.

        I got fed up recently of the insane number of requests that were given over to my use of disqus here on my blog. I&rsquo;ve had it enabled since moving from Wordpress to various other blogging engines, wanting to take my comments with me to a static blogging engine, but enough is enough. I remember disqus being a darling in the startup scene when it first launched in 2007 but it&rsquo;s changed hands several times since and the idea that randoms ads may turn up on my blog at some point is a massive turn off.

        This week, I revealed mixes.it - a very simple site I&rsquo;ve created for indexing DJ mixes scraped from the web. I wanted a no-frills site that I could get Spotify playlists of DJ&rsquo;s I like to see what new music they were playing and that I didn&rsquo;t have to spend much time supporting.
I used Astro and Supabase to create the site itself and the whole thing is currently built using Netlify.

        When first hearing of the concept of &ldquo;no-code&rdquo; I have to admit I cringed a bit. The implication that a mere mortal client could combine services without ever getting a dev involved seemed cute and definitely wouldn&rsquo;t lead to anything genuinely valuable.
I come from the age of Hackathons, where a devs would quickly put together really interesting combinations of services in the blink of an eye. They would do all this for nothing more than the joy of building, rather than the offer of expensive prizes from some well funded business as a form of motivation.

        Requests is the HTTP client I and every Python developer I know always reach for when we need to pull data from remote sources. It got 121M downloads in June 2021 alone according to PePy and has 45.5k github stars at the time of writing. Developers love making requests with Requests!
At the time of Requests original release in 2011 urllib3 was the high level HTTP library of choice and Requests actually uses it as a dependency.

The Launchpad is a midi controller used for audio production with digital audio workstations (or DAWs) like Ableton. In comes in mini and standard forms and features 64 pads, along with 16 additional buttons ready to map to your application of choice. The mini version starts at £75, the standard is £145 and there&rsquo;s an older &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; which is currently available for £179.

        I thought it worth documenting how to install &ldquo;extra&rdquo; dependencies in Pipenv and Poetry after struggling to find the answer myself. Context: I hit a problem with uvicorn where the websockets module hadn&rsquo;t been installed as a result of not including the &ldquo;standard&rdquo; extras. Rather than return an error, it just failed to connect the websocket which made me think something was wrong with my network configuration.
As an example, take the following pip command:

        The popularity of working on small experiments (or &lsquo;bets&rsquo;) as business ideas before investing a significant amount of time upon one of them is a model of work rapidly gaining traction with indie hackers.
It makes so much sense - when you&rsquo;re small and in need of money to fund your work, you don&rsquo;t waste time on ideas which are unproven. Instead you choose to work on a portfolio of many ideas over a short period of time to see which ones resonate with customers.

        I recently updated my 2012 Mac Mini with a 2021 M1 Mac Mini and decided to document the first time setup process. You can also check out a youtube video I&rsquo;ve made on setting it up. What follows is all the steps in written form as a handy reference for you to copy and paste from - or future me. Surprisingly, the installation process was fairly simple now there are versions of software written for Apples new architecture.
