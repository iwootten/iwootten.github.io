        When running some Cypress tests in Github Actions that were inspecting dates recently, I wanted to be able to set the locale of the browser - specifically for Chrome which I was using with Cypress.
Originally, I’d thought this require a step within setting up the github action environment itself, but this doesn’t change anything - presumably because the cypress github action runs in a separate step.
Turns out it is possible, but by using the chrome devtools protocol.

        Unless you’ve been hidden under a rock, you’re likely aware of Copilot - Github’s (or Microsofts) AI pair programmer. It allows you to get help on the code you’re writing by bringing up suggestions through an autocomplete snippets when you begin typing code in your editor.
 Since it started its free beta back in the summer of last year, it’s been the subject of many developers videos and it’s even played a part in a few of mine.

        If you’re using vues router to link to dynamic URLs you may get stuck wondering why your props on router-links aren’t being sent to your components. Vue’s router doesn’t support sending props directly. So you can’t do something like this:
&lt;router-link class=&#34;...&#34; :to=&#34;{ path: `/user/edit/`, id=id }&#34; &gt;Edit &lt;/router-link&gt; Here the id prop will never get passed in routers default configuration. Instead you need to configure each of your routes to pass the route params as props like so:

        Over the last 11 Years, I&rsquo;ve gone from PC die hard to owning 4 different Macs for development. There&rsquo;s one place I&rsquo;ve bought them all over this time and that&rsquo;s through the Apple Certified Refurbished store (US, UK). If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, this is where Apple resells returned hardware which has undergone a thorough certification process at a discount to customers. Best of all, it comes with the same 1 year warranty as if you bought it brand new from Apple.

        This weekend, I released my first ever digital product. It&rsquo;s only been available for 2 days and is already my most successful product ever with a grand total of 3 sales, yielding a massive $15! I jest, but this is all totally true. In the past I&rsquo;ve run a web hosting service, a TShirt company before becoming an employee and then freelance developer 10 years ago. I still have boxes of tshirts that I haven&rsquo;t sold and none of my previous product ventures have made me a profit.

        Your blog is a financial investment and you should treat it as such. I know, that might be stretch to some - but I have 15 years worth of analytics for this very blog that shows what happens when you don&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ve always found it strange that those who are deeply involved in building the web don&rsquo;t have any form of online presence. Most of that time I&rsquo;ve thought of a website as a great advertisement that gives clients and employers a way of finding more out about you.

        I love Poetry, but one thing I always find frustrating is having to add an additional package to my environments to read from .env files and access them as environment variables. I quite often default to Pipenv for simple projects to get round this. Turns out there’s now another way.
Poetry 1.2 will add plugin support to tweak or add to it&rsquo;s default package management behaviour and @mpeteuil made one for .

        I recently wrote an article that got to the #1 spot on Hacker News for the folks at ScrapingBee. It focused on retrieving details for the 90,000+ featured products from the Product Hunt API and digging into interesting facets of the data. I was excited to see it sat at the #1 for a few hours and the frontpage for longer whilst I repeatedly took screenshots to regale my children with in later life.

        Using AWS Lambda for your serverless Python app can give significant cost and management benefits. However, unless your needs are simple you will quickly need to bundle your dependencies along with your functions. Doing so with an AWS Lambda Layer works much like installing dependencies within a local environment. You are able to reduce each functions size, maintain your core code separately and simply tell the function to use the layer when setting it up.

        The animation below is a 3D render of the actual positions of the lights from my Christmas tree in 2021 using p5.js. Unlike my actual Christmas tree, this one won&rsquo;t be taken down and will run all year round (save for the few occasions Github might go down).
Calculating the LEDs coordinates is taken from an idea by mathematician Matt Parker where they are lit individually one at a time and the brightest area is logged in each of the x, y and z axes.
