<span class=item__date>Feb 23, 2022</span>
Your blog is a financial investment and you should treat it as such. I know, that might be stretch to some - but I have 15 years worth of analytics for this very blog that shows what happens when you don&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;ve always found it strange that those who are deeply involved in building the web don&rsquo;t have any form of online presence. Most of that time I&rsquo;ve thought of a website as a great advertisement that gives clients and employers a way of finding more out about you.

<span class=item__date>Feb 18, 2022</span>
I love Poetry, but one thing I always find frustrating is having to add an additional package to my environments to read from .env files and access them as environment variables. I quite often default to Pipenv for simple projects to get round this. Turns out there’s now another way.
Poetry 1.2 will add plugin support to tweak or add to it&rsquo;s default package management behaviour and @mpeteuil made one for .

<span class=item__date>Feb 15, 2022</span>
I recently wrote an article that got to the #1 spot on Hacker News for the folks at ScrapingBee. It focused on retrieving details for the 90,000+ featured products from the Product Hunt API and digging into interesting facets of the data. I was excited to see it sat at the #1 for a few hours and the frontpage for longer whilst I repeatedly took screenshots to regale my children with in later life.

<span class=item__date>Jan 27, 2022</span>
Using AWS Lambda for your serverless Python app can give significant cost and management benefits. However, unless your needs are simple you will quickly need to bundle your dependencies along with your functions. Doing so with an AWS Lambda Layer works much like installing dependencies within a local environment. You are able to reduce each functions size, maintain your core code separately and simply tell the function to use the layer when setting it up.

<span class=item__date>Jan 10, 2022</span>
The animation below is a 3D render of the actual positions of the lights from my Christmas tree in 2021 using p5.js. Unlike my actual Christmas tree, this one won&rsquo;t be taken down and will run all year round (save for the few occasions Github might go down).
Calculating the LEDs coordinates is taken from an idea by mathematician Matt Parker where they are lit individually one at a time and the brightest area is logged in each of the x, y and z axes.

<span class=item__date>Dec 29, 2021</span>
This Christmas, I decided to make our tree lights incredibly complex so that I could marvel at my own animations running on them. That&rsquo;s tongue and cheek, but also ended up being very true.
I&rsquo;d been inspired by mathematician Matt Parker in 2020 where he did this. In this post I&rsquo;ll describe all the hardware I used and how it was connected and I&rsquo;ll share the code I needed to write to capture the LED&rsquo;s coordinates.

<span class=item__date>Nov 29, 2021</span>
I setup my Raspberry Pi using Bullseye and installed many of the same developer tools I use on my main dev machine for Python upon it. You can also check out a youtube video I&rsquo;ve made on setting it up here. I did this from scratch with a brand new install, with all available updates installed at the time. Bullseye is the most recent release of Raspberry Pi OS which came out earlier this month, based on Debian Bullseye.

I got fed up recently of the insane number of requests that were given over to my use of disqus here on my blog. I&rsquo;ve had it enabled since moving from Wordpress to various other blogging engines, wanting to take my comments with me to a static blogging engine, but enough is enough. I remember disqus being a darling in the startup scene when it first launched in 2007 but it&rsquo;s changed hands several times since and the idea that randoms ads may turn up on my blog at some point is a massive turn off.

<span class=item__date>Sep 10, 2021</span>
This week, I revealed mixes.it - a very simple site I&rsquo;ve created for indexing DJ mixes scraped from the web. I wanted a no-frills site that I could get Spotify playlists of DJ&rsquo;s I like to see what new music they were playing and that I didn&rsquo;t have to spend much time supporting.
I used Astro and Supabase to create the site itself and the whole thing is currently built using Netlify.

<span class=item__date>Aug 10, 2021</span>
When first hearing of the concept of &ldquo;no-code&rdquo; I have to admit I cringed a bit. The implication that a mere mortal client could combine services without ever getting a dev involved seemed cute and definitely wouldn&rsquo;t lead to anything genuinely valuable.
I come from the age of Hackathons, where a devs would quickly put together really interesting combinations of services in the blink of an eye. They would do all this for nothing more than the joy of building, rather than the offer of expensive prizes from some well funded business as a form of motivation.
