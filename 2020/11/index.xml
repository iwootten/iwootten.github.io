      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some features I found interesting in the release of Python 3.9 last month. You can see me talk about each of these in my latest video on youtube.
Full Release Notes
Merging and Updating Dictionaries From PEP 584 - Dictionaries now have new union operators to work with them.
Python 3.8:
x = {&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;original_value&amp;#39;} y = {&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;updated_value&amp;#39;} print({**x, **y}) # Python 3.8 unpacking, kind of confusing Python 3.</description>

      <description>When I first started working in software development teams, I can remember heated discussions on pull requests on a few occasions. Typically these were when I or other developers reviewed code that didn&amp;rsquo;t meet formatting rules that were felt best for that piece of work. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether the rules in question were in code, documented in a README or just held in a developers head, the simple fact that something was wrong on the project meant the author needed to make changes, be severely reprimanded and never make the mistake again.</description>
