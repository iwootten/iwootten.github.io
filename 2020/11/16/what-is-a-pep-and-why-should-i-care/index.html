    <p>No doubt if you&rsquo;ve been developing in Python for any length of time, you will have heard the acronym &ldquo;PEP&rdquo; mentioned quite frequently. More often than not you hear it when talking about Python code style, usually followed by the number &ldquo;8&rdquo;. So what is a PEP and why should you care?</p>
<h1 id="what-is-a-pep">What is a PEP?</h1>
<p>PEP stands for &ldquo;Python Enhancement Proposal&rdquo;. They are used to describe and summarise the technical design and reasons for enhancements to Python and surrounding processes. Each PEP is followed by a number, which never changes.  They are written with the core developers of Python as the main audience.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New in Python ..&rdquo; posts written with each release list the PEPs that have been implemented in each release. Here&rsquo;s the latest one for <a href="https://docs.python.org/release/3.9.0/whatsnew/3.9.html">Python 3.9</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pep-types">PEP Types</h2>
<p>There are 3 kinds of PEP descriptions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Standards Track</strong>: Describes a new feature or implementation</li>
<li><strong>Informational</strong>: Describes a design issue or guidelines</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>: Describes a change to process surrounding Python, but not to Pythons' codebase.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="how-are-peps-decided">How are PEP&rsquo;s decided?</h1>
<p>PEPs are initially discussed on the python-ideas email list before being written formally by a author/co-author. A PEP author then submits a PR to the <a href="https://github.com/python/peps">PEP repository</a> containing the proposed PEP. If none of the authors are core-developers, then a sponsor (author mentor) is needed to guide an author through this the PEP submission workflow. A PEP is reviewed by a PEP editor and if the PEP passes all standards checks and is approved, it is assigned a number. The Python steering council hold the final say in whether a PEP should be accepted or rejected.</p>
<h1 id="why-should-you-care-about-peps">Why should you care about PEPs?</h1>
<p>Although the primary audience of PEP&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t necessarily a developer who just happens to use Python, PEPs are available to all to read. I find it interesting to dig into the details of why a particular set of decisions has been made in a particular way. Being able to see the entire technical document describing how a new feature works at the point it becomes readily available as part of a Python release is incredibly useful, where a quick summary might not suffice. I need not wait for other developers to document how they work as I can see for myself.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very useful to have a documented process (as Part of <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/">PEP1</a>) how any developer might go about suggesting and making improvements to the Python language that they feel would be a benefit. This makes the process accessible to any developer.</p>
<h1 id="interesting-peps">Interesting PEPs</h1>
<p>Below are a number of interesting PEP&rsquo;s I found over the course of my research for this post. Enjoy!</p>
