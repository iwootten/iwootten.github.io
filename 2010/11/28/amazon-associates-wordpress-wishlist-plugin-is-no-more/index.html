    <p>I think my post title says it all really. I’ve just discovered that amazon has deprecated use of its ListLookup method since October 15th. I had used this in order to retrieve details of my amazon wishlist and display neatly on my blog using <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/04/02/amazon-associates-wordpress-wishlist-plugin">my wishlist plugin</a>. Now it seems I’m forced to generate one with their own widget builder. This in turn means my wordpress plugin will no longer work. Sorry for those who were making use of it, or would like to use it. It’s also apparent that this is a kick in the teeth for developers building sites entirely dependant on this method. <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=53342">This chap estimates he made $11k in the last year using this function</a>. This is the trouble with building stuff that relies on third party services. I wonder how much more of their api they will gradually remove?</p>
