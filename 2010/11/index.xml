      <description>I think my post title says it all really. I&amp;#8217;ve just discovered that amazon has deprecated use of its ListLookup method since October 15th. I had used this in order to retrieve details of my amazon wishlist and display neatly on my blog using my wishlist plugin. Now it seems I&amp;#8217;m forced to generate one with their own widget builder. This in turn means my wordpress plugin will no longer work.</description>
