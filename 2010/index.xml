I’ve just discovered that amazon has deprecated use of its ListLookup method since October 15th. I had used this in order to retrieve details of my amazon wishlist and display neatly on my blog using my wishlist plugin. Now it seems I’m forced to generate one with their own widget builder. This in turn means my wordpress plugin will no longer work.</description></item><item><title>Installing gPhoto on Snow Leopard</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/09/09/installing-gphoto-on-snow-leopard/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/09/09/installing-gphoto-on-snow-leopard/</guid><description>I always seem to choose the difficult route to do things. Having become equipped with a new canon camera, I’m instantly wanting to capture stop motion shorts with it. Unfortunately canons proprietry capture software isn’t really up to the job and FrameByFrame doesn’t work with such high-end cameras.
So, I got to thinking wether there was any other route? I was aware of the gPhoto commandline interface and libgphoto pointed out by a colleague some time ago, so I thought I’d see what I might be able to do with it.</description></item><item><title>How not to: Do A Hack Day</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/07/24/how-not-to-do-a-hack-day/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/07/24/how-not-to-do-a-hack-day/</guid><description>It’s been well over a month since I attended science hack day and I’d thought I’d put out some notes on my time there. Rather than do a run down of the event, for which I’m sure there’s far more comprehensive blog posts available already, I thought I’d share my experiences based on attendance of a number of different hack events I’ve been to over the years. I went with the full intention of doing some hardcore hacking, but didn’t entirely meet my own expectations.</description></item><item><title>Installing MPlayer on Snow Leopard</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/06/15/installing-mplayer-on-snow-leopard/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Jun 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/06/15/installing-mplayer-on-snow-leopard/</guid><description>Here’s a heads up for anyone installing MPlayer on Snow Leopard. I’ve been playing a fair amount with tools recently and inevitably ending up running round in circles in installing, compiling, setting flags etc. Here’s a quick one liner param for anyone compiling mplayer (and freetype as its dependency) which people on Snow Leopard may find useful.
You’ll first need to download latest versions of freetype and mplayer. Uncompress both. (Check here that the command “file /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.</description></item><item><title>Lovefilm Filmstream Plugin for WordPress</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/04/18/lovefilm-filmstream-plugin-for-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/04/18/lovefilm-filmstream-plugin-for-wordpress/</guid><description>Something I’ve thought I’d like to have on my site for a while is a list of movies that I’ve recently seen and some brief opinions on them. I’m not entirely sure how I would go about this for films I see at the cinema, or whether I could muster the stamina to review every single film I’ve watched, but a recent television upgrade has now meant I’ve got the opportunity to do this.</description></item><item><title>Mixbooth</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/03/21/mixbooth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/03/21/mixbooth/</guid><description>Mixbooth is a dj mix hosting service I created several years ago. At the time there wasn’t a lot around in terms of options for allowing anyone to share them. You either had to exchange it upon a site filled with advertisements, or host it on your own space which might mean you’d breach your server bandwidth for any given month. I decided to use some space I had available at next to nothing to build something that might be of use to myself and any other dj whom saw fit to use it.</description></item><item><title>Fair Bare - January £10 Sale!</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/01/07/fair-bare-january-10-sale/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/01/07/fair-bare-january-10-sale/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
