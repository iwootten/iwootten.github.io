I’m not entirely sure how I would go about this for films I see at the cinema, or whether I could muster the stamina to review every single film I’ve watched, but a recent television upgrade has now meant I’ve got the opportunity to do this.</p><p>Our television came with a years subscription to <a href=http://www.lovefilm.com>lovefilm</a>, which means I can now track our past film watching history. At four blu rays a month, that’s quite a lot of films over the course of the year.</p><p>Love Film have recently opened up their doors with an api and <a href=http://developer.lovefilm.com>developer area</a> (which unfortunately is not particularly active at the moment). Anyway – their documentation is pretty thorough and has made the process of creating a wordpress plugin to display my past rentals really simple. You can see some example output of it on my site <a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/filmstream>over here</a>.</p><p>You can grab the plugin over <a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/filmstream.zip>here</a>. It’s authenticated by oauth (for which you’ll require php on your blog host to be compiled with oauth enabled) and so will bounce you over to <a href=http://www.lovefilm.com>lovefilm</a> to ask for access to your account, but after that will update on a daily basis. Just click “Fetch Items” on the filmstream admin page and stick <code>&lt;!--filmstream_content--></code> in any page to display a table containing all your past rentals. There’s no options to speak of right now, but I’m sure I’ll be extending it in the future.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2010/03/21/mixbooth/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
