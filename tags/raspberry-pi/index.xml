      <title>Rendering a Christmas Tree that Never Comes Down with p5.js</title>

      <description>The animation below is a 3D render of the actual positions of the lights from my Christmas tree in 2021 using p5.js. Unlike my actual Christmas tree, this one won&amp;rsquo;t be taken down and will run all year round (save for the few occasions Github might go down).
Calculating the LEDs coordinates is taken from an idea by mathematician Matt Parker where they are lit individually one at a time and the brightest area is logged in each of the x, y and z axes.</description>

      <description>This Christmas, I decided to make our tree lights incredibly complex so that I could marvel at my own animations running on them. That&amp;rsquo;s tongue and cheek, but also ended up being very true.
I&amp;rsquo;d been inspired by mathematician Matt Parker in 2020 where he did this. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe all the hardware I used and how it was connected and I&amp;rsquo;ll share the code I needed to write to capture the LED&amp;rsquo;s coordinates.</description>

      <description>I setup my Raspberry Pi using Bullseye and installed many of the same developer tools I use on my main dev machine for Python upon it. You can also check out a youtube video I&amp;rsquo;ve made on setting it up here. I did this from scratch with a brand new install, with all available updates installed at the time. Bullseye is the most recent release of Raspberry Pi OS which came out earlier this month, based on Debian Bullseye.</description>

The Launchpad is a midi controller used for audio production with digital audio workstations (or DAWs) like Ableton. In comes in mini and standard forms and features 64 pads, along with 16 additional buttons ready to map to your application of choice. The mini version starts at £75, the standard is £145 and there&amp;rsquo;s an older &amp;ldquo;Pro&amp;rdquo; which is currently available for £179.</description>
