      <description>I setup my Raspberry Pi using Bullseye and installed many of the same developer tools I use on my main dev machine for Python upon it. You can also check out a youtube video I&amp;rsquo;ve made on setting it up here. I did this from scratch with a brand new install, with all available updates installed at the time. Bullseye is the most recent release of Raspberry Pi OS which came out earlier this month, based on Debian Bullseye.</description>
