      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve purchased a couple of .is straight from the Icelandic Domain Registry (ISNIC) in the past year with a view to using them with my own vps. The process of setting up nameservers isn&amp;#8217;t great, given their somewhat confusing management interface. That&amp;#8217;s summed up in a recent tweet below.
Looks like I just spent 39 euros on a domain I canâ€™t use. Fucksticks.

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&amp;#8217;ll be rewarded. It&amp;#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the small hosting company that I&amp;#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&amp;#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &amp;#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.</description>
