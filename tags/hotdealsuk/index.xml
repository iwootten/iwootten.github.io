      <description>I came across hotdealsukprior to christmas and I think its an absolute must for any techie thats currently residing in the uk. Basically, a sophisticated messageboard, bargains of interest to the community are highlighted and then voted upon. Those more highly voted make it through to the front page.
I absolutely love it and so far have managed to purchase 1 xbox (with 4 games) @ £50 and a 400Gb harddrive @ £83.</description>
