      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve just updated my amazon associates plugin to take into account the recent signiture changes which amazon have introduced for their webservices api.
This now also means you&amp;#8217;ll have to enter your amazon secret access key in the plugin configuration page.
You can download the updated version over here.
It also means my wishlist has finally been brought back to life. Just in time for Christmas&amp;#8230;</description>

      <title>Amazon Associates WordPress Wishlist Plugin</title>

      <description>One of the things that&amp;#8217;s bugged me for a while whilst having a website is that at certain times of the year when people might actually like to buy me a gift they&amp;#8217;re unable to find my wishlist. This is mainly because they&amp;#8217;re simple folk who might not think to check amazon for my name. I&amp;#8217;m also signed up with amazon associates, so I decided it could do me well to post my wishlist items along with my referral tag in the links in order to earn a bob or two on my own homepage.</description>
