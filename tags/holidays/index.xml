Well, aside from not being here – I’ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I’ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we’re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it’s never had a home before and we’ve never owned it.</description></item><item><title>Mull</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/07/08/mull/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/07/08/mull/</guid><description>So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).</description></item><item><title>Holidays Soon!</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/06/17/holidays-soon/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jun 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/06/17/holidays-soon/</guid><description>Woohoo, rock on – its almost holiday season for me. Next week I’ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh…Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I’ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who’ll be there with me – you best make it a good’n.</description></item><item><title>Normality Check</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/26/normality-check/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/26/normality-check/</guid><description>Our last day in Jard was rather less exciting than we’d hoped, we decided to clean the place* we were staying in, so spent the morning doing that and unfortunately the weather was cack so didn’t make for much of an afternoon either. We apparently caught the back end of a heatwave this week which has been rather fortunate, although pretty uncomfortable in the evenings. (Tim had it worse being in the same room as Mr ‘Exorcist’ Pete, I had to endure that in Germany so it’s his turn this time).</description></item><item><title>Pastis and Miniatures - 22/06/2005 - 23/06/2005</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/23/pastis-and-miniatures-22/06/2005-23/06/2005/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/23/pastis-and-miniatures-22/06/2005-23/06/2005/</guid><description>Yesterday not a lot happened, except for much reading and bumming around the house whilst trying out my newly found juggling skills. We also went on our search for pastis, after discovering that it actually tasted much the same as oizo, a wicked aniseed flavour…I think Rach may need to be educated in its use however, due to filling a wine glass neat with the stuff, which I would of been dead if I’d actually consumed undiluted, or at least extremely quiet for the rest of the evening.</description></item><item><title>Beer and Beaches</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/21/beer-and-beaches/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/21/beer-and-beaches/</guid><description>Decided to make a move on to our next beach today, taking with us a picnic and a load of beer. This one is situated right next to a forest, which was ace for our picnic.
Tim, after 3 years of living with one another has finally managed to teach me to juggle and give me the bug for continuing it. It’s actually easier to learn using boule, forcing you to use correct arm movements, though its a little dangerous on the beach if you have a distinct lack of footwear.</description></item><item><title>Wine and Marshes</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/20/wine-and-marshes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/20/wine-and-marshes/</guid><description>Today we went over to the salt marshes in Olonne, it being slightly more manageable weather and all. Tim basically wanted to do a little birdwatching and Heledd and Dave didn’t fancy such french beauty so went to have coffee in a suitable village somewhere. It was really cool, took lots of photos of the strange green murky waters and had a bunch of exercise too. Saw loads of eels while we were there – horrible things writhing about….</description></item><item><title>Wine and Beaches</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/19/wine-and-beaches/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/19/wine-and-beaches/</guid><description>Sunday’s morning events weren’t overly exciting – the weather has been so hot that it would be a bit much to go off and try to do anything. Instead has been a morning of reading (Dahl’s ‘Boy’ – bizzarrely featuring Cardiff, La Rochelle and Somerset within) and people trying to juggle. The afternoon became overcast so we decided to make the trip down to the beach, where Tim, Rach and Pete all got rather dirty trying to recreate a eurotunnel experience, which was destroyed as soon as it was completed by Dave.</description></item><item><title>Long Journeys - 17/06/05 - 18/06/05</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/18/long-journeys-17/06/05-18/06/05/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Jun 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/06/18/long-journeys-17/06/05-18/06/05/</guid><description>So, it begins, the holiday season that is and with it my two day trip across England and back down the west coast of France to Jard Su Mer. Todays trip was fairly long, spending two hours bombing down the M4 to meet with the guys in Reading, then a further few to reach the underside of London on the M25, and a bit more to finally bundle over toward the Eurotunnel.</description></item></channel></rss>
