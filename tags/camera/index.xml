      <description>I always seem to choose the difficult route to do things. Having become equipped with a new canon camera, I&amp;#8217;m instantly wanting to capture stop motion shorts with it. Unfortunately canons proprietry capture software isn&amp;#8217;t really up to the job and FrameByFrame doesn&amp;#8217;t work with such high-end cameras.
So, I got to thinking wether there was any other route? I was aware of the gPhoto commandline interface and libgphoto pointed out by a colleague some time ago, so I thought I&amp;#8217;d see what I might be able to do with it.</description>
