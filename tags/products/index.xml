      <description>This weekend, I released my first ever digital product. It&amp;rsquo;s only been available for 2 days and is already my most successful product ever with a grand total of 3 sales, yielding a massive $15! I jest, but this is all totally true. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve run a web hosting service, a TShirt company before becoming an employee and then freelance developer 10 years ago. I still have boxes of tshirts that I haven&amp;rsquo;t sold and none of my previous product ventures have made me a profit.</description>

      <description>In my 18 years online, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent large chunks of time exploring ideas that never came into fruition. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone years building out software I&amp;rsquo;ve never made into saleable products for a multitude of reasons. The standard indie hacker journey would have you believe that this is time wasted, pointless where iterating quickly and shipping products that sell would get you to that magic monthly recurring revenue you so desperately desire.</description>
