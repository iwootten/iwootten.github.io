      <description>In this book, author David Upton walks you through use of the Code Igniter framework, which is essentially PHP&amp;#8217;s answer to Ruby on Rails. I&amp;#8217;ve been a avid user of Code Igniter since I discovered it last year, which is a nice waypoint for anyone trying to understand model-view-controller architectures and not wanting to make the move over to ROR quite yet.
The angle of this book is taken from a first time CI developer, but one with some knowledge of both PHP and web development in general.</description>
