      <description>If my years in academia have taught me anything, it&amp;#8217;s that insight obvious to you isn&amp;#8217;t often obvious to others.
As a result, I&amp;#8217;ve pretty much adopted a gung-ho hacker attitude towards getting my own ideas built whereby I&amp;#8217;ll just often work to get an iteration of an site out as fast as possible. The only factor here is my own time and I&amp;#8217;m in the fortunate position to have some of that available now and again.</description>
