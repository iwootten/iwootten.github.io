      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve purchased a couple of .is straight from the Icelandic Domain Registry (ISNIC) in the past year with a view to using them with my own vps. The process of setting up nameservers isn&amp;#8217;t great, given their somewhat confusing management interface. That&amp;#8217;s summed up in a recent tweet below.
Looks like I just spent 39 euros on a domain I can’t use. Fucksticks.

      <description>Friday last week I woke up to a barrage of emails coming into my inbox. All of these were coming from notification of spam comments upon this very blog. By the time I’d woken up I’d had something like 75 emails. This was pretty strange given that Akismet was there guarding my blog ever since it’s been available and I’d never had a email about a dodgy comment since I’d set it up (something like 5 years ago).</description>
