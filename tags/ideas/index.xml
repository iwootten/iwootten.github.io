      <description>I suffer from idea overload. It seems that every day I have an idea for something. As a developer, I&amp;#8217;m lucky in that to be able to take an idea to inception very quickly. Best of all, I can show it at inception stage to a huge audience (if I had one), garner feedback and quickly iterate on that idea. To date, I&amp;#8217;ve mainly created these by myself &amp;#8211; a casualty of doing paid work in the main like this too.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve heard a couple of rumours this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&amp;#8217;s some discussion over on facereviews.com that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &amp;#8220;social networks&amp;#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for?</description>
