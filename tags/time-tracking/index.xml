      <description>So, anybody paying close attention may have noticed I&amp;#8217;ve skipped a week on updating my progress on shipping in March. There wasn&amp;#8217;t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my Nifty Digits site. This hasn&amp;#8217;t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month.</description>
