      <description>Having heard the question raised on @workingoutshow, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take some time to share the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve found have really helped me be productive in my work. These may not work for everyone, but hopefully some points will help for others.

We&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough to have a small garden at our house and with the arrival of my daughter back in October, I was quick to realise that working in the open plan lounge in our house just wasn&amp;rsquo;t a viable option any more.</description>
