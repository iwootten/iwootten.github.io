      <description>The popularity of working on small experiments (or &amp;lsquo;bets&amp;rsquo;) as business ideas before investing a significant amount of time upon one of them is a model of work rapidly gaining traction with indie hackers.
It makes so much sense - when you&amp;rsquo;re small and in need of money to fund your work, you don&amp;rsquo;t waste time on ideas which are unproven. Instead you choose to work on a portfolio of many ideas over a short period of time to see which ones resonate with customers.</description>

      <description>As a freelancer who has worked with clients using non disclosure agreements in the past, it&amp;rsquo;s often difficult to showcase or build a portfolio of my work. I&amp;rsquo;m not alone on this, I know. Sarah Parmenter for one has posted about this problem as a designer.
As a developer, I sometimes feel it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to easily show a concise representation of my work in a public arena anyway. How can I convey my role in what will usually be a complex process involving many other parties?</description>
