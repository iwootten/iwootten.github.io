      <description>I got the Valve Steam Deck last month and have instantly become obsessed with it. I wanted to know if I could use it as a linux dev machine, knowing that it was essentially a full blown PC under the hood. You&amp;rsquo;re able to be use a keyboard and mouse with SteamOS in desktop mode with everything setup over the sole USB-C port via a dongle.
User Setup SteamOS is built upon arch linux, which gives you a familiar environment if you&amp;rsquo;ve used a linux distro before.</description>
