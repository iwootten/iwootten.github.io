      <description>I was inspired yesterday by watching a few vids on the internet of crazy kids doing trials unicycling, so decided to go out for a ride in the evening round Roath Park. It&amp;#8217;s been a long time since I&amp;#8217;ve ridden, but it seems you don&amp;#8217;t forget. Nor do the &amp;#8216;oh I&amp;#8217;m original&amp;#8217; taunts cease, such as &amp;#8220;oi, mate, you&amp;#8217;ve lost a wheel!&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;pull a wheelie!&amp;#8221; etc etc. Anyway, it was nice to finally ride mine without fear of the horrid scratching which I usually obtain from my previous saddle.</description>
