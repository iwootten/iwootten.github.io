      <description>I watched a video earlier this week by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker. It’s an entertaining walkthrough of some impressive optimisation of his own Python code by his community but there&amp;rsquo;s a comment about Python that I thought warranted some pushback.
That comment was that ‘Python will very rarely make it into production’. The implication being that it’s a language used only really for prototyping at which point you’ll bring out the raw grunt of another language - such as C++ or C to do some real work.</description>

      <description>The popularity of working on small experiments (or &amp;lsquo;bets&amp;rsquo;) as business ideas before investing a significant amount of time upon one of them is a model of work rapidly gaining traction with indie hackers.
It makes so much sense - when you&amp;rsquo;re small and in need of money to fund your work, you don&amp;rsquo;t waste time on ideas which are unproven. Instead you choose to work on a portfolio of many ideas over a short period of time to see which ones resonate with customers.</description>
