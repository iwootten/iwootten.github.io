      <description>In this book, author David Upton walks you through use of the Code Igniter framework, which is essentially PHP&amp;#8217;s answer to Ruby on Rails. I&amp;#8217;ve been a avid user of Code Igniter since I discovered it last year, which is a nice waypoint for anyone trying to understand model-view-controller architectures and not wanting to make the move over to ROR quite yet.
The angle of this book is taken from a first time CI developer, but one with some knowledge of both PHP and web development in general.</description>

      <description>Learning jQuery takes a look at the JavaScript library jQuery by Jonathan Chaffer and Karl Swedberg, whom run learningjquery.com, a popular resource to jQuery developers. Jonathan and Karl work through a example based approach of common problems in web application development to demonstrate how jQuery can be used to minimize the amount of code written by developers and instead focus on the functionality of their code. The book is set for the developer with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript but a jQuery novice.</description>
