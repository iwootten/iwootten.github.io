      <description>This is a brief retrospective of what I&amp;#8217;ve learned in the 6 years I&amp;#8217;ve been running Fair &amp;#038; Bare, a Fairtrade t-shirt company along with my wife.
If you&amp;#8217;re a new follower of mine, you heard right &amp;#8211; I run a Fairtrade t-shirt company. I&amp;#8217;ve not actively been marketing it more recently for a number of reasons, but I still have a strong belief in our original vision. That vision was that Fairtrade shirts at the time weren&amp;#8217;t being well received by the world, despite being available.</description>

      <description>It seems that all I do these days is talk about what&amp;#8217;s going on over at Fair &amp;#038; Bare and if you&amp;#8217;re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I&amp;#8217;ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what&amp;#8217;s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.</description>

      <title>New T-Shirts from Fair &amp; Bare</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &amp;#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. 

We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&amp;#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released.</description>

      <title>Fair and Bare - Bringing Design to Fairtrade</title>

      <description>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I&amp;#8217;m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with fairdos and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don&amp;#8217;t appeal to us at all.</description>
