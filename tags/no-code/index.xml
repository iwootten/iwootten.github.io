      <description>When first hearing of the concept of &amp;ldquo;no-code&amp;rdquo; I have to admit I cringed a bit. The implication that a mere mortal client could combine services without ever getting a dev involved seemed cute and definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lead to anything genuinely valuable.

They would do all this for nothing more than the joy of building, rather than the offer of expensive prizes from some well funded business as a form of motivation.</description>
