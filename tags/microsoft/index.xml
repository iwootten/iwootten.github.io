      <description>Mashable is reporting that a Microsoft-Yahoo merger may be on the cards, which is a fairly bizarre prospect.
The price? $50 Billion, is Yahoo only worth 30 odd YouTubes? I for one think not.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;#8217;t really understand microsoft, over the last few days, their live network has been experiencing problems every time I&amp;#8217;ve tried to logon to access my email. Who knows what my 8 emails contain which are hidden within live mail, I certainly don&amp;#8217;t. You would think that more people would be in uproar about this &amp;#8211; I mean what if these were payment requests, final demands or quick response business proposals?</description>
