      <description>I feel compelled to write this post so late in the day after clocking Tyler Renelle&amp;#8217;s rant on github about his problems with the popularity of certain JS frameworks (in the main Backbone.js). After having written apps in a variety of JS frameworks (Backbone, Spine and Meteor), I&amp;#8217;ve learned that the feature set of a framework is not the only thing I hold dear when making a choice between them.</description>

      <description>When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000&amp;#8242;s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites &amp;#8211; that was it.
As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: &amp;#8220;UX Designers&amp;#8221; were the first to appear on the scene to me, and we&amp;#8217;re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails.</description>
