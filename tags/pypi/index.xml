      <description>In creating my first package on PyPI, I realised that many of the tasks I&amp;rsquo;d want to do on a subsequent publish would be repetitive. If I wanted to push out a simple fix, I wanted to automate away those tasks so I could focus on my code rather than a sequence of repetitive steps.
Github actions is a simple way to do this and has given me the ability to quickly push out changes without lots of manual work.</description>

      <description>I recently published my first ever package to the Python Package Index (PyPI). The process was particularly novel for me as it meant my first ever use of the Poetry package management tool. If you happen to work in a production studio that uses ftrack and is now working remotely, you might even want to take a look at it as it enables sharing of assets using the Simple Storage Service (S3) from Amazon Web Services.</description>
