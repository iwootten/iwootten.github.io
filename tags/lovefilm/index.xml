      <description>Given there&amp;#8217;s a bit of lovefilm bashing going on in Wales at the moment, I thought I&amp;#8217;d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm.
Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I&amp;#8217;ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.

I really couldn&amp;#8217;t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema&amp;#8217;s to perform reviews and certainly don&amp;#8217;t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image.</description>

      <title>Lovefilm Filmstream Plugin v0.2</title>

      <description>Just a quick note to say I&amp;#8217;ve updated the plugin that generates my filmstream pages. It&amp;#8217;s become obvious that the Lovefilm API only exposes the last 10 features that you&amp;#8217;ve rented in their &amp;#8220;at home&amp;#8221; list. This isn&amp;#8217;t that great if you&amp;#8217;ve been renting more than a few months. This is the same as the information you&amp;#8217;d see in your account when logged in.
I&amp;#8217;ve made a simple modification to use the actual ids that Lovefilm issue for films, rather than a autoincrement value.</description>

      <description>Something I&amp;#8217;ve thought I&amp;#8217;d like to have on my site for a while is a list of movies that I&amp;#8217;ve recently seen and some brief opinions on them. I&amp;#8217;m not entirely sure how I would go about this for films I see at the cinema, or whether I could muster the stamina to review every single film I&amp;#8217;ve watched, but a recent television upgrade has now meant I&amp;#8217;ve got the opportunity to do this.</description>
