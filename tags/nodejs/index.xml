      <description>When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000&amp;#8242;s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites &amp;#8211; that was it.
As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: &amp;#8220;UX Designers&amp;#8221; were the first to appear on the scene to me, and we&amp;#8217;re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails.</description>

      <title>Pagination in CouchDB Apps</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on some fun little node.js / couchdb projects of late. Given the fact I don&amp;#8217;t use either as part of my work, I&amp;#8217;ve spent some downtime experimenting and slowly iterating my approaches as I learn best practice.
I hit what I consider to be a fairly frustrating hurdle that couchdb threw up that I&amp;#8217;ve been blissfully unaware of through all my couchdb dev. When it came to doing pagination it turns out I&amp;#8217;ve always been doing it the &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; way.</description>

      <title>Maintaining References to Sockets with Express and Socket.io</title>

      <description>I hit a frustrating problem when trying to use expressjs alongside socket.io recently. The solution may seem somewhat trivial, but I struggled with it for a while, until finally asking for help on the socket.io irc channel. I&amp;#8217;m not sure if a better solution exists for my case, but this is what I have for now.
In the main route of my express app, I needed to iterate across an array, performing a REST call using each element as a parameter and spit the results back for socket.</description>

      <description>Over the last little while, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of playing with Node.js, mostly to run data collection scripts. Last week, I started following Ciaran Jessup&amp;#8217;s tutorial on getting started with node.js, Express and mongoDB. Express acts as a framework to node.js, allowing you to work in a familiar mvc format in a not so familar server side language. I hit a few problems along the way in the tutorial, so I thought I&amp;#8217;ve list a few of my findings here.</description>
