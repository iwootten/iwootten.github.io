      <description>There&amp;#8217;s some discussion on new podcast &amp;#8220;The Back to Front Show&amp;#8221; on why of late we&amp;#8217;re seeing so many static websites cropping up. It seem like now more than ever, we&amp;#8217;re seeing both developers and designers jump ship to this way of working, having long been using database backed solutions (such as WordPress/Drupal) to manage their publishing.
When I talk about a static site, I think of it of raw HTML sat on a server and nothing else.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;#8217;t help but feel a little sorry for music blogs as of late. I&amp;#8217;m sure you may be familiar with The Hype Machine and may use it on a daily basis. For the uninitiated, it is essentially a music blog aggregator, which takes details of tracks and ranks them based on how often they appear and how popular they are. I&amp;#8217;ve found it really interesting to browse around and discover new artists.</description>
