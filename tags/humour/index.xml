      <description>Today on the return from uni I passed the new Subway that is opening up soon near Queen Street train station. On one of their job adverts, they were advertising for team leaders and sandwich artists. I&amp;#8217;ve never really noticed my sandwiches being arranged in a artistic fashion before, maybe it would brighten my day if they were. I feel sorry for the poor art school graduate who ends up filling baguettes for a living.</description>

      <description>This link sent to me by Lewis made me laugh quite a lot. Funnily, it looks a lot like him with a wig on.</description>
