Unlike my actual Christmas tree, this one won&amp;rsquo;t be taken down and will run all year round (save for the few occasions Github might go down).
Calculating the LEDs coordinates is taken from an idea by mathematician Matt Parker where they are lit individually one at a time and the brightest area is logged in each of the x, y and z axes.</description></item><item><title>How to Code Christmas Tree LEDs (and find their 3D Coordinates)</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2021/12/29/how-to-code-christmas-tree-leds-and-find-their-3d-coordinates/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 12:15:49 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2021/12/29/how-to-code-christmas-tree-leds-and-find-their-3d-coordinates/</guid><description>This Christmas, I decided to make our tree lights incredibly complex so that I could marvel at my own animations running on them. That&amp;rsquo;s tongue and cheek, but also ended up being very true.
I&amp;rsquo;d been inspired by mathematician Matt Parker in 2020 where he did this. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe all the hardware I used and how it was connected and I&amp;rsquo;ll share the code I needed to write to capture the LED&amp;rsquo;s coordinates.</description></item></channel></rss>
