      <description>Mixbooth is a dj mix hosting service I created several years ago. At the time there wasn&amp;#8217;t a lot around in terms of options for allowing anyone to share them. You either had to exchange it upon a site filled with advertisements, or host it on your own space which might mean you&amp;#8217;d breach your server bandwidth for any given month. I decided to use some space I had available at next to nothing to build something that might be of use to myself and any other dj whom saw fit to use it.</description>
