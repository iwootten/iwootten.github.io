      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing some really good stuff about openID recently. For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It&amp;#8217;s recently risen to light with the adoption by WordPress.com as a provider and digg as an adopter.Complaints against wordpress.com&amp;#8217;s non-allowance of logins with openID&amp;#8217;s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded.</description>
