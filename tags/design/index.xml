Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I’ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.
I really couldn’t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema’s to perform reviews and certainly don’t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image.</description></item><item><title>New Adventures 2012 - Self Help for Web Designers</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/01/23/new-adventures-2012-self-help-for-web-designers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/01/23/new-adventures-2012-self-help-for-web-designers/</guid><description>Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for New Adventures 2012. I’d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand.
I’ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn’t miss a thing.</description></item><item><title>Fair and Bare's first shirt!</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/07/22/fair-and-bares-first-shirt/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Jul 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/07/22/fair-and-bares-first-shirt/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Fair and Bare - Bringing Design to Fairtrade</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/05/06/fair-and-bare-bringing-design-to-fairtrade/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/05/06/fair-and-bare-bringing-design-to-fairtrade/</guid><description>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I’m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with fairdos and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don’t appeal to us at all.</description></item><item><title>Which would you rather introduce yourself with?</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/09/11/which-would-you-rather-introduce-yourself-with/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Sep 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/09/11/which-would-you-rather-introduce-yourself-with/</guid><description>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my “business” cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim.

I felt like writing “beta” on hand hand-made ones or something…</description></item><item><title>pMachine changes its name</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/09/pmachine-changes-its-name/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/09/pmachine-changes-its-name/</guid><description>pMachine has changed its name to Ellislab, and are sporting a shiny new website for all to see. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don’t fall under the same banner now. I’m glad to see that the CodeIgniter website has got a facelift. 31three did the hard graft on the design and they all look awesome.</description></item></channel></rss>
