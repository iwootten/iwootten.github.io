      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve long wondered why there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be much happening in terms of community of the web professionals in wales. There is a vibrant collection of people sporting different skill sets in the area, yet as I can see not a lot of chat amongst everyone in between different groups. On a whim, I decided to create a facebook group &amp;#8220;Cardiff Web Geeks&amp;#8221; to try and get people to come out of their shells and actually participate in a bit of discussion about tech topics in wales.</description>
