      <description>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I&amp;#8217;m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with fairdos and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don&amp;#8217;t appeal to us at all.</description>
