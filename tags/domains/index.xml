      <description>I just sent the following email to 1 &amp;#038; 1&amp;#8242;s billing department. I&amp;#8217;ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.
As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.</description>
