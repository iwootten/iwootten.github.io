      <description>Introduction This week, I revealed mixes.it - a very simple site I&amp;rsquo;ve created for indexing DJ mixes scraped from the web. I wanted a no-frills site that I could get Spotify playlists of DJ&amp;rsquo;s I like to see what new music they were playing and that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to spend much time supporting.
I used Astro and Supabase to create the site itself and the whole thing is currently built using Netlify.</description>

      <description>When first hearing of the concept of &amp;ldquo;no-code&amp;rdquo; I have to admit I cringed a bit. The implication that a mere mortal client could combine services without ever getting a dev involved seemed cute and definitely wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lead to anything genuinely valuable.
I come from the age of Hackathons, where a devs would quickly put together really interesting combinations of services in the blink of an eye. They would do all this for nothing more than the joy of building, rather than the offer of expensive prizes from some well funded business as a form of motivation.</description>
