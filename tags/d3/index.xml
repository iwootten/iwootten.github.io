      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had the opportunity of using d3 quite a lot over the past few months for a number of clients. It offers some amazing flexibility for chart generation and much more.
Anyway, I thought I&amp;#8217;d share a quick tip I developed for mapping a linear set of values onto an ordinal scale. For those who&amp;#8217;re seasoned pros at d3, this probably seems trivial, but had me stumped for some time today.</description>
