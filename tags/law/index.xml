      <description>On June 1st 2014, some much needed changes are being made to exceptions to copyright law which amongst other things, will allow conversion of personal media between file formats.
Finally, we&amp;#8217;ll able to make personal conversions of digital media (at least they will be now counted as legal copies). I&amp;#8217;ve long made copies of my cd&amp;#8217;s to listen to whilst coding (iTunes allows me to do so simply) &amp;#8211; but it is not currently legal to move these files to another storage medium, such as an mp3 player.</description>
