      <description>So, anybody paying close attention may have noticed I&amp;#8217;ve skipped a week on updating my progress on shipping in March. There wasn&amp;#8217;t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my Nifty Digits site. This hasn&amp;#8217;t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month.</description>

      <description>I came across hotdealsuk prior to christmas and I think its an absolute must for any techie thats currently residing in the uk. Basically, a sophisticated messageboard, bargains of interest to the community are highlighted and then voted upon. Those more highly voted make it through to the front page.
I absolutely love it and so far have managed to purchase 1 xbox (with 4 games) @ £50 and a 400Gb harddrive @ £83.</description>
