      <description>Introduction This week, I revealed mixes.it - a very simple site I&amp;rsquo;ve created for indexing DJ mixes scraped from the web. I wanted a no-frills site that I could get Spotify playlists of DJ&amp;rsquo;s I like to see what new music they were playing and that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to spend much time supporting.
I used Astro and Supabase to create the site itself and the whole thing is currently built using Netlify.</description>
