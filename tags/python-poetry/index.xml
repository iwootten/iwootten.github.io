      <description>I recently published my first ever package to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

If you happen to work in a production studio that uses ftrack and is now working remotely, you might even want to take a look at it as it enables sharing of assets using the Simple Storage Service (S3) from Amazon Web Services.</description>
