In it, I found an old lunch pass from school (featuring a photo sporting a lovely little version of me) and lots of old encouragement sheets we used to pass around our youth group to gets lots of positive comments on ourselves. Most of these are at least 5 years old and some stretch back to 10.</description></item><item><title>Introducing...</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/11/29/introducing.../</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Nov 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/11/29/introducing.../</guid><description>I spent the weekend back at home in recognition of my parents 30th wedding anniversary. It’s quite bizarre looking through their wedding photos (I’d never seen them before) and picking out all my relatives in mini form. Said previous ladyfriend decided she’d brave the border as well to make those “all important” first introductions. She might of thought better of it if she knew parentals were going to bring their saturday night party back to ours and keep everyone awake until the early hours.</description></item><item><title>Millions of Wrongs don't Make it Right</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/08/01/millions-of-wrongs-dont-make-it-right/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/08/01/millions-of-wrongs-dont-make-it-right/</guid><description>I’ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I’d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it’s quite the opposite really.
My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it’s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase.</description></item><item><title>How far have I come?</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/04/22/how-far-have-i-come/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Apr 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/04/22/how-far-have-i-come/</guid><description>Having free time in the evenings recently is a wonderful thing, and its given me the chance to think about ‘stuff’ I might not of done otherwise, recently its been my undergrad life. When I came to University, I was all fired up for an amazing walk through Christendom, I tried to throw myself into the Christian Union, and for a while it was great. Unfortunately my work got a grip of me very quickly, and for all the wrong reasons I backed off from CU and any kind of fellowship with others.</description></item><item><title>Vineyard reclaiming the web</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2004/12/14/vineyard-reclaiming-the-web/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2004 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2004/12/14/vineyard-reclaiming-the-web/</guid><description>Cardiff Vineyard have got to be the biggest bunch of bloggers I’ve ever met, in a non-derogitory sense.

They have been doing a whole bunch of different events this week as an opportunity to witness to those who might not normally come to YCC otherwise. Today was the big finale of the week and was basically all the families who had been a part of the week meeting up with the members of the Church.
What that amounts to is lots of barbeques and little kiddies events galore.</description></item></channel></rss>
