      <description>I suffer from idea overload. It seems that every day I have an idea for something. As a developer, I&amp;#8217;m lucky in that to be able to take an idea to inception very quickly. Best of all, I can show it at inception stage to a huge audience (if I had one), garner feedback and quickly iterate on that idea. To date, I&amp;#8217;ve mainly created these by myself &amp;#8211; a casualty of doing paid work in the main like this too.</description>

      <description>In order for me to generate this post I&amp;#8217;ve created something quite novel on my blog &amp;#8211; a new category which I&amp;#8217;ve not had a great deal of experience in previously, &amp;#8220;work&amp;#8221;. For the last couple of months I&amp;#8217;ve been working for Aardman features in Bristol on their forthcoming feature film, &amp;#8220;Pirates&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; building software, which I&amp;#8217;ll be doing at least for the next couple of months too.
I&amp;#8217;ve been having an amazing experience over this time.</description>
