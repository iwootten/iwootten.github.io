      <description>Your blog is a financial investment and you should treat it as such. I know, that might be stretch to some - but I have 15 years worth of analytics for this very blog that shows what happens when you don&amp;rsquo;t.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it strange that those who are deeply involved in building the web don&amp;rsquo;t have any form of online presence. Most of that time I&amp;rsquo;ve thought of a website as a great advertisement that gives clients and employers a way of finding more out about you.</description>
