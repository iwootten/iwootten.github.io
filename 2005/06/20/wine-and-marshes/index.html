    <p>Today we went over to the salt marshes in Olonne, it being slightly more manageable weather and all. Tim basically wanted to do a little birdwatching and Heledd and Dave didn’t fancy such french beauty so went to have coffee in a suitable village somewhere. It was really cool, took lots of photos of the strange green murky waters and had a bunch of exercise too. Saw loads of eels while we were there – horrible things writhing about….</p>
<p>Lunch heralded more wine – sweet aperitif’s before and more red during. I’m thinking the rest of the week will hold lots more judging from wine connisieur Dave.. Enlightened myself by making lots of names from pomme frites.</p>
<p>On to another book ‘Life of Pi’ by Yann Martel. Bit weird so far.</p>
