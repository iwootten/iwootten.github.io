    <p>Sunday&#8217;s morning events weren&#8217;t overly exciting &#8211; the weather has been so hot that it would be a bit much to go off and try to do anything.

The afternoon became overcast so we decided to make the trip down to the beach, where Tim, Rach and Pete all got rather dirty trying to recreate a eurotunnel experience, which was destroyed as soon as it was completed by Dave.</p>

<p>People have done a great job of selecting french foods, we&#8217;ve had all manner of bread, cheeses and hams while we&#8217;ve been here so far and a shedload of wine to boot.</p>
