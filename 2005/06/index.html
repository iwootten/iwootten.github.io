      <div class="author_meta">29 Jun 2005</div>

          <p>Today I travelled on 2 planes, 3 buses and 1 car (thats a full house and extra) to make the 800 mile round trip to Edinburgh for part of a <a href="http://www.bdworld.org">BioDiveristyWorld</a> conference. I&#8217;m quite surprised I managed to organise and sort out everything since Monday and it go according to plan.</p>
<p>I was actually really overwhelmed at how amazing the place was for the brief time I was there, the sheer scale of the city was something else. Too bad I couldn&#8217;t stick about for the G8 conference and related protests/festivals, despite comments about riots being thrown around, it would of been something to tell the kids. Anyways, I&#8217;ve got Steve and Hannah&#8217;s wedding back home to go to on Saturday. The 5:00am start has not been the best thing for me though, I will sleep like the proverbial log tonight.</p>

          <p>I forgot to write a classic quote I found in &#8216;Boy&#8217; while I was away so I thought I&#8217;d shove it up now. I think it encompasses how I feel about work at the moment. Really enjoyed just lazing about reading in France for ages, finished Pi, although I found it to drag on somewhat, the quirky bit at the end made it fairly clever. Onto some Pratchett now after resisiting for ages. Anyways, here you go..</p>
<p>&#8216;The life of a writer is absolute hell compared with the life of a businessman. The writer has to force himself to go to work. He has to make his own hours and if he doesn&#8217;t go to his desk at all there is nobody there to scold him. If he is a writer of fiction he lives in a world of fear. Each new day demands new ideas* and he can never be sure whether he is going to come up with them or not. Two hours of writing fiction leaves this particular writer absolutely drained. For those two hours he has been miles away, he has been somewhere else, in a different place with totally different people, and the effort of swimming back into normal surroundings is very great. It is almost a shock. The writer walks out of his workroom in a daze. He wants a drink. He needs it. It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him. He does it to give himself faith, hope and courage. A person is a fool to become a writer. His only compensation is absolute freedom. He has no master except his own soul*, and that I&#8217;m sure, is why he does it.&#8217;</p>
<p>*I&#8217;d say this goes for non-fiction too&#8230;</p>
<p>*Except of course if he subscribes to one of a number of religions&#8230;..or in Pi&#8217;s case, a number of religions</p>

          <p>Our last day in Jard was rather less exciting than we&#8217;d hoped, we decided to clean the place* we were staying in, so spent the morning doing that and unfortunately the weather was cack so didn&#8217;t make for much of an afternoon either. We apparently caught the back end of a heatwave this week which has been rather fortunate, although pretty uncomfortable in the evenings. (Tim had it worse being in the same room as Mr &#8216;Exorcist&#8217; Pete, I had to endure that in Germany so it&#8217;s his turn this time). In the evening we had a final celebratory meal, before heading off on Saturday&#8230;.</p>
<p>Finally we complete the trip in reverse mode, go up France, get separated from convoy, get lost in a different city, randomly meet up in city, get lost again in same city, find desired route, randomly meet again at services, get to Calais, hotel, sleep, brekkie, chunnel, motorway, Reading, food, lost camera, find camera, motorway, Cardiff. Yay! no trying to speak a language I&#8217;ve never been taught! Back to work tomoz. I&#8217;m tired. Night.</p>

    *We also cleaned the place the next day before we left, before being booted out by a woman who&#8217;d been sent to clean (doh!).

      <div class="author_meta">23 Jun 2005</div>

          <p>Yesterday not a lot happened, except for much reading and bumming around the house whilst trying out my newly found juggling skills. We also went on our search for pastis, after discovering that it actually tasted much the same as oizo, a wicked aniseed flavour&#8230;I think Rach may need to be educated in its use however, due to filling a wine glass neat with the stuff, which I would of been dead if I&#8217;d actually consumed undiluted, or at least extremely quiet for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>Today we split our separate ways with Heledd, Dave and I continuing a previously started &#8216;Amazing Microworld&#8217; Adventure with a visit to the miniature museum in Vendee. The previous adventure, started in Bath a couple of years back was claimed to be amazing &#8216;or your money back&#8217;, we were determined to not be impressed, but alas could not contain ourselves &#8211; something like those actimel adverts. Therefore, we didn&#8217;t feel it proper to try and claim our money back. Although todays trip was slightly less impressive (much larger) it was still a laugh.</p>
<p>We spent our afternoon on the beach again &#8211; you&#8217;d think the locals had never seen a frisbee, or maybe thats the way we were playing. Last day tomorrow, best make the most of it!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">21 Jun 2005</div>

          <p>Decided to make a move on to our next beach today, taking with us a picnic and a load of beer. This one is situated right next to a forest, which was ace for our picnic.</p>
<p>Tim, after 3 years of living with one another has finally managed to teach me to juggle and give me the bug for continuing it. It&#8217;s actually easier to learn using boule, forcing you to use correct arm movements, though its a little dangerous on the beach if you have a distinct lack of footwear. There was three of us praticing it on the beach, I think the locals were a little taken aback. I may even bring my unicycle up to er, uni and try and practice atop that. Not that I&#8217;ve done that since first year.</p>
<p>Finally got a picture of the Renault &#8216;Twingo&#8217;, which in my opinion looks exactly like one of the baby robots from &#8216;Batteries Not Included&#8217;.</p>
<p>All this french food must be getting to me, during my meal down in the &#8216;port (- no the one in Jard Sur Mer, not Wales), I was actually photographed inserting something green into my gob (or was I taking it out? &#8211; you decide). It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like salad, it just doesn&#8217;t have a lot of flavour, which my brain is fooled into thinking it doesn&#8217;t like and tries to wretch it up as with all those other foods.</p>
