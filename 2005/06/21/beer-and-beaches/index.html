    <p>Decided to make a move on to our next beach today, taking with us a picnic and a load of beer. This one is situated right next to a forest, which was ace for our picnic.</p>

<p>Tim, after 3 years of living with one another has finally managed to teach me to juggle and give me the bug for continuing it. It&#8217;s actually easier to learn using boule, forcing you to use correct arm movements, though its a little dangerous on the beach if you have a distinct lack of footwear. There was three of us praticing it on the beach, I think the locals were a little taken aback. I may even bring my unicycle up to er, uni and try and practice atop that. Not that I&#8217;ve done that since first year.</p>

<p>Finally got a picture of the Renault &#8216;Twingo&#8217;, which in my opinion looks exactly like one of the baby robots from &#8216;Batteries Not Included&#8217;.</p>

<p>All this french food must be getting to me, during my meal down in the &#8216;port (- no the one in Jard Sur Mer, not Wales), I was actually photographed inserting something green into my gob (or was I taking it out? &#8211; you decide). It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like salad, it just doesn&#8217;t have a lot of flavour, which my brain is fooled into thinking it doesn&#8217;t like and tries to wretch it up as with all those other foods.</p>
