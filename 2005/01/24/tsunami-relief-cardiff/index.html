    <p>I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic&#8230;! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I&#8217;d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!) and Jools and Eric Clapton&#8217;s finale. What was quite gutting was the fact I was stuck in a queue when the Manics were on, so I didn&#8217;t even see them on the stage&#8230;. <img src="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>I felt it kind of patronising though to be sitting there in a huge concert, with all these amazing artists, while the real reason we were there was to provide support for all those poor people who&#8217;d suffered through this horrible ordeal. It was almost like we were celebrating such a tragic event, rather than mourning over it. For some reason I don&#8217;t look at &#8220;Live Aid&#8221; in the same kind of light, I expect it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t really there to witness it (being 3 and not understanding and all). I suppose events such as these do do a fantastic job of bringing media attention about though, not that there&#8217;s really any need at the moment, it&#8217;s all the news seems to cover at the moment (and why not? It is after all the most tragic natural disaster since I don&#8217;t know when). I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going with this&#8230; that was perhaps a little deep for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, here are links to some pics of the event. They gradually deteriorate in quality, so Jools and Eric aren&#8217;t looking at their best I&#8217;m afraid.
