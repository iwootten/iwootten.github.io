      <description>I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic&amp;#8230;! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I&amp;#8217;d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!</description>

      <description>So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life&amp;#8230;boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John&amp;#8217;s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.</description>
