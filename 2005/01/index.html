<div class="author_meta">24 Jan 2005</div>
<p>I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic…! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I’d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!) and Jools and Eric Clapton’s finale. What was quite gutting was the fact I was stuck in a queue when the Manics were on, so I didn’t even see them on the stage…. <img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>I felt it kind of patronising though to be sitting there in a huge concert, with all these amazing artists, while the real reason we were there was to provide support for all those poor people who’d suffered through this horrible ordeal. It was almost like we were celebrating such a tragic event, rather than mourning over it. For some reason I don’t look at “Live Aid” in the same kind of light, I expect it’s because I wasn’t really there to witness it (being 3 and not understanding and all). I suppose events such as these do do a fantastic job of bringing media attention about though, not that there’s really any need at the moment, it’s all the news seems to cover at the moment (and why not? It is after all the most tragic natural disaster since I don’t know when). I don’t know where I’m going with this… that was perhaps a little deep for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, here are links to some pics of the event. They gradually deteriorate in quality, so Jools and Eric aren’t looking at their best I’m afraid.</p>

<div class="author_meta">07 Jan 2005</div>
<p>So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life…boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John’s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.</p>

<p>I had a wicked time over New Years with the Southampton/Cardiff posse in Beddgelert, climbing Snowdon and enduring other peoples (mostly Stephen’s) sleeping habits. New Years Eve was especially great due to the copius amounts of party items that were flung our way by the local’s landlord. Check out the images here:  </p>

    I&#8217;m playing my first gig tonight, over at BSB with the <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com" title="Off The Shelf website">&#8220;Off The Shelf&#8221;</a> guys, so am especially nervous at the mo. Luckily, it&#8217;s billed as a birthday party for Waldron so hopefully there&#8217;ll be a bit of a different atmosphere than normal.
