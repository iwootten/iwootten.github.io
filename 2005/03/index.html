          <p>Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday. Me being a little bit more independant of late, thought sod it and went by myself, getting bought drinks by Phantom Beats (the guy I went to see) while I was there&#8230;nice.</p>
<p>I just returned from my actual birthday here at home, bowling&#8230;..exciting stuff! Ah well, once again not that many people about, with a distinct lack of things available to do in our small town in Somerset. The cream on the cake is I just discovered on returning, I share my birthday with a great comedian &#8211; namely <a href="http://frostitution.net/" title="Fanpage">Nick Frost</a>, star of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead fame. Rock on!</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m trying to decide what to do for my birthday which falls on Bank holiday monday this year. Currently I&#8217;m of the mind to do something on Good Friday like have a meal, then off to town (Chico Fresco and Phantom Beats will be at bsb apparently)&#8230;.Leaving me free to go back and have easter and my actual birthday with family and friends. I&#8217;m going to be 24&#8230;<em>24</em>,<strong>24?!</strong>, no surely thats not right! I still feel about 18 and all my years as an undergrad never happened, I certainly don&#8217;t <em>act</em> my age. Ah well, I&#8217;ll get over it..It&#8217;s not actually that big a deal. I&#8217;ll have to anyway, it&#8217;ll happen again next year. If anyones about in cardiff then and wants to help me celebrate, please let me know!</p>
<p>I had my first quote immortalised upon our quote board at home, I&#8217;m usually quite careful not to say anything stupid with housemates about, thats Tim&#8217;s job, but this was due to a recent trip to the bay. I was talking to Cath Evans about my last trip to the bay (on my 20th birthday co-incidentally), where upon we were set upon by a load of kids off of the estate who decided to throw rocks at us whilst waiting for the train. Anyway it reads <em>&#8220;This is my first trip to the bay since we got stoned on my birthday.&#8221;</em> I think a lot of people on the train got an unintended impression of me after that conversation.</p>

          <p>I was a right little Heathen yesterday and skived off of housegroup to meet up with Mr Bryer in Bristol to see the awesome <a href="http://www.lemonjelly.ky" title="Lemon Jelly">Lemon Jelly</a>. Whats even better was the fact that <a href="http://www.sonicflux.co.uk">Ben Lilford</a> had come along too, unbeknown to me before arriving. They are quite literally the most amusing band ever. Prior to the Jel&#8217;s entrance we were treated to Don Partridge (a one man band) whilst trying to play a couple of party games (find 3 stooges hidden in the audience).</p>
<p>I think the best moment of the evening was everyone was dancing to the vocal from &#8220;Nice Weather For Ducks&#8221; over some really heavy beats. It&#8217;s taken from an old nursery rhyme and goes <em>&#8220;All the ducks are swimming in the water, fah la la la rahldo, fah la la la rahldo&#8221;</em> or something like that, you can hear a more downtempo version <a href="http://www.cissme.com/bgroup-us/rm/xl/lemon/video/ifxls156dvd-01_rvh.ram">here</a>. It&#8217;s got to be the only place I&#8217;m ever gonna be dancing alongside a horde of drunken louts (one of which insisting at making <em>the</em> most annoying moose sound after every track), one very sweet and tiny little old lady and still feel content. </p>

          <p>Ok, not to totally contradict my last post, I&#8217;ve just read a comedy web page all about me that was put up 5 years ago which I never knew existed! You might like to take a look <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/presence/dj.htm">here</a>. It seems my music tastes haven&#8217;t changed all that much, as the songs I quote are all still top tunes&#8230;I may of gotten all technical for no reason.</p>
