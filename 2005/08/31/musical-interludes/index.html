    <p>These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj&#8217;ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe&#8217;s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I&#8217;m a bit out of practice.</p>

<p>Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band <a href="http://www.walkingwounded.co.uk">&#8220;Walking Wounded&#8221;</a> all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support). One of the conversations I had while I was there was with the infamous Carl (who was playing some crazy dub and reggae), revealing the sad news that Fridays <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com">&#8220;off the shelf&#8221;</a> at BSB is to come to an end. Its a bit of a shame, the guys had a great set-up there, gave me the odd gig offer now and then and I&#8217;ve met a fair few randoms through events they&#8217;ve put on, always enjoying it due to all the guys having a sound appreciation of good music. So long&#8230;</p>

<p>An afterparty from Zoe&#8217;s meant a bit of a late one on Friday, although a night absolutely chocka of funky soul, breaks and beats from full-fat at Moloko&#8217;s. It was a great night, great music and a great change to be making such a trip with a posse rather than being a loner. The same can be said of last night, due to the trip over to Bristol for Jurassic 5&#8242;s performance. Although <a href="http://www.cutchemist.com">Cut Chemist</a> wasn&#8217;t there, Numark absolutely rocked the place with the solo&#8217;s he&#8217;d put together, with one crazy &#8220;do-wop&#8221; solo. It was fab to finally see him in action, after all the vids I&#8217;ve watched of him with Chemist and DJ Shadow. I stunk so much of weed when I returned it was disgusting.</p>

<p>Anyway, seems I&#8217;ve been inspired to check out a few random artists on Warp, namely Brothemstates (did the music for the Sprite ad) and the Rip Off Artist from Kid 606&#8242;s Tigerbeat Label. I also ordered the KEEPINTIME dvd off ninjatune by, er, pretty much everyone :). <a href="http://www.warprecords.com">Warp</a> and <a href="http://www.ninjatune.net">Ninjatune</a> are both having sales of sorts at the moment if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
