      <description>So, in the absence of students, life continues as normal for the various research teams down here in the Queens buildings. We wake, march to University and sit in our little boxes reading, theorising and tearing our hair out until 5 o&amp;#8217;clock when we march back, only to be repeated the next day. I hate routines&amp;#8230;
Today marked the graduation of Year 3&amp;#8242;s which brought back memories of my graduation last year, which was pretty depressing to be honest.</description>

      <description>It&amp;#8217;s been a good week thus far. Saturday marked a return to Somerset to attend Steve and Hannah&amp;#8217;s wedding, which I was a little late for due to having to pick up a number of interesting things I&amp;#8217;ve been given by Gran. I felt a little harsh having to dash in, collect and leave, it felt a little like Dad and I were looting the place.
Being late was ok as one of the speakers was following in just after me (apparently a bit of a search was going on for him prior to the service), confirming we were good to creep through the large arched doors as the sound of singing could be heard.</description>
