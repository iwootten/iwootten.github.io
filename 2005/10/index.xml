      <description>I went round to Living Stones last night for a bit of a lads night with Jon, Dan, Rob and Joe for music and watching Batman Begins. I took a number of Cd&amp;#8217;s for Dan and I to listen to, which basically reflected the &amp;#8220;base&amp;#8221; around which the majority of all my other music stems from. It&amp;#8217;s quite odd trying to verbalise how a particular song makes you feel, why you feel uplifted by it, how it captures a particular moment in time, thought, etc etc.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been attending a fair few &amp;#8216;live&amp;#8217; gigs recently as oppose to the frequenting of clubs in Cardiff. The first was the fantastic R&amp;ouml;yksopp, whom I was dubious to see alone, but glad I did. Quite frankly they were as great live as I could possibly hope for and the addition of the huge inflatable tape and scrolling info about each song added to the experience.
More recently, I got to see &amp;#8220;Bowling for Soup&amp;#8221; at union on Friday, which allowed me to experience the &amp;#8216;delights&amp;#8217; of teen punk as well as some awful &amp;#8220;post-punk laptop &amp;copy;rap&amp;#8221; from Mc Lars who seemed confused as to where exactly Cardiff featured in the UK.</description>

      <description>I found a wicked animation by Maria Claudia Cortes describing what personalities a bunch of colours are often attributed with. I reckon I&amp;#8217;m a mixture of red and blue, my wardrobe reflects this as well. What colour are you?</description>

      <description>Whats the most annoying thing ebuyer could leave out of my order for my building a new PC? That&amp;#8217;s it &amp;#8211; the OS, so I can build my lovely little machine, but not actually use the thing until they get their act together. Nice one guys, you suck ass.</description>

      <title>CD Greedy</title>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve always bought lots of music. Those of you who&amp;#8217;ve had the privilege of viewing my collection will have seen it spans all manner of media, Tape, CD, MD, Vinyl. I&amp;#8217;ve recently been doing a lot of random browsing on ebay for CD&amp;#8217;s that have previously escaped me and possibly buying a few other items from the same seller to save on postage. My biggest one though has to be my most recent, 12 albums from the same seller.</description>
