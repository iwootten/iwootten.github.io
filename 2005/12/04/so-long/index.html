    <p>On Thursday morning, Maggie, our eldest labrador at home was taken to the vet to be put down. She’d been poorly for sometime and had become unable to walk, for any reason whatsoever. Maggie was a member of our family for the past 13 years, so it’s understandably a bit of a loss to us all. It’s strange to think back to when we first got her, making apologies to numerous teachers for the state the new books I’d been given had gotten into so quickly. My first attempt at constructing a sentence in german was down to her. Throughout her life she enjoyed many long walks, swims, knock-out runs at mum, putting energetic young scamps (Rex) back into line and any food she could get her paws on.</p>
<p>So long mags, you’ll be missed.</p>
