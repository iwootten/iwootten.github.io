<div class="author_meta">18 Apr 2005</div>
<p>I’ve been running around a bit like a headless chicken recently, not content with spending lots of time at uni working, I’ve been partying pretty hard as well. </p>

<p>Spent Friday going to Kez’s 21st birthday for a meal at Old Orleans, which was rather tasty. Bombed back to hang out with Vineyardites at Marty’z Kitchen, which we were duely moved on from to Cafe aroma, and back to mine (after a few choice insults were uttered by me) for a nice cuppa. After that, decided to go on to Sumo at the Welsh club with Aquasky and Masterblaster, once again having a fab time on my own and dancing about like a loon with drunks I don’t know. Bit of a late one was that – arriving back for 4. </p>

<p>After project meetings on Saturday to discuss our trip today with the other half of the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="PASOA">PASOA</a> project in Southampton, I didn’t have time to attend a bar-b I’d been invited too, and instead went straight over to Jon and Cathy’s for rather random games evening with lots of lego and frustrating “Guess Who” games. I was a tad upset to find that after nipping to the loo, all my passengers had defected to the dark side by going back with Jennie – the cheek! After confronting her on Sunday she also announced she’d stolen my aerial off my car! Gah!</p>

<p>All in all a fab weekend, though I don’t think I could keep it up every week.</p>

<p>Note to self 1: Games where I (or as a member of a team, ahem – Rob) lose, are rubbish, especially played against girls. That’s probably why I enjoy playing shoot-em-ups offline (or against Tim).</p>

<p>Note to self 2: Don’t go calling the children of your Church leaders names, not even in jest, it has a habit of getting back to them.</p>

<div class="author_meta">05 Apr 2005</div>
<p>There’s loads of places on the net where you can view silly or stupid signs. Most of the ones I’ve seen aren’t from the UK though, and I can’t imagine them any kind of scenario, which I think would make them all the more funny. This place has loads, so many I can’t afford to look through all of them. I can’t believe I’ve missed it before.</p>

<p>If I had something interesting to say I would say it, but I don’t really so instead I’ll hit you with a few ebay bargains I’ve picked up of late. Currently I’m holding a rating of 166 positive, I reckon thats pretty good. Anybody else bought anything interesting off the net lately?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4713354993&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">Cut N Paste – Forget It</a> [12” Single] (£1.99). I’ve been after this ever since I heard it on a Fatboy Slim ‘On the Floor at the Boutique’ mix CD donkeys years ago….</li>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;category=64228&#038;item=7952327398">David Nicholls – Starter For Ten</a> [Book] (£0.01). I started this after getting annoyed with reading huge mundane chunks of history in 1984. Loads of this is so close to the truth its scary, I’ve carried stupidly heavy things across Cardiff for instance, more than once actually, just to save a quid or so. Its great, despite being a “Richard and Judy Bookclub Bestseller”.</li>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4707809284&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">LHB – Tell ‘Em Who We Are</a> [CD Album] (£0.99) This is an absolutely amazing album, can’t see how I’ve ever missed it before. Even more so as these guys were once big beat wonders back on good old Bolshi records.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=6157425220&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">4.5M x 0.75M ‘Scrumpy Jack’ banner</a> (£4.00). This is pure comedy value. Just need to find a way of hanging this on the wall…was provided with a few ropes…hmm..</li>

<div class="author_meta">28 Mar 2005</div>
<p>Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday. Me being a little bit more independant of late, thought sod it and went by myself, getting bought drinks by Phantom Beats (the guy I went to see) while I was there…nice.</p>

<p>I just returned from my actual birthday here at home, bowling…..exciting stuff! Ah well, once again not that many people about, with a distinct lack of things available to do in our small town in Somerset. The cream on the cake is I just discovered on returning, I share my birthday with a great comedian – namely <a href="http://frostitution.net/" title="Fanpage">Nick Frost</a>, star of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead fame. Rock on!</p>

<h1><a href="/2005/03/14/birthday-blues">Birthday Blues</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">14 Mar 2005</div>
<p>I’m trying to decide what to do for my birthday which falls on Bank holiday monday this year. Currently I’m of the mind to do something on Good Friday like have a meal, then off to town (Chico Fresco and Phantom Beats will be at bsb apparently)….Leaving me free to go back and have easter and my actual birthday with family and friends. I’m going to be 24…<em>24</em>,<strong>24?!</strong>, no surely thats not right! I still feel about 18 and all my years as an undergrad never happened, I certainly don’t <em>act</em> my age. Ah well, I’ll get over it..It’s not actually that big a deal. I’ll have to anyway, it’ll happen again next year. If anyones about in cardiff then and wants to help me celebrate, please let me know!</p>

<p>I had my first quote immortalised upon our quote board at home, I’m usually quite careful not to say anything stupid with housemates about, thats Tim’s job, but this was due to a recent trip to the bay. I was talking to Cath Evans about my last trip to the bay (on my 20th birthday co-incidentally), where upon we were set upon by a load of kids off of the estate who decided to throw rocks at us whilst waiting for the train. Anyway it reads <em>“This is my first trip to the bay since we got stoned on my birthday.”</em> I think a lot of people on the train got an unintended impression of me after that conversation.</p>

<h1><a href="/2005/03/10/lemon-jelly">Lemon Jelly</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">10 Mar 2005</div>
<p>I was a right little Heathen yesterday and skived off of housegroup to meet up with Mr Bryer in Bristol to see the awesome <a href="http://www.lemonjelly.ky" title="Lemon Jelly">Lemon Jelly</a>. Whats even better was the fact that <a href="http://www.sonicflux.co.uk">Ben Lilford</a> had come along too, unbeknown to me before arriving. They are quite literally the most amusing band ever. Prior to the Jel’s entrance we were treated to Don Partridge (a one man band) whilst trying to play a couple of party games (find 3 stooges hidden in the audience).</p>

<p>I think the best moment of the evening was everyone was dancing to the vocal from “Nice Weather For Ducks” over some really heavy beats. It’s taken from an old nursery rhyme and goes <em>“All the ducks are swimming in the water, fah la la la rahldo, fah la la la rahldo”</em> or something like that, you can hear a more downtempo version <a href="http://www.cissme.com/bgroup-us/rm/xl/lemon/video/ifxls156dvd-01_rvh.ram">here</a>. It’s got to be the only place I’m ever gonna be dancing alongside a horde of drunken louts (one of which insisting at making <em>the</em> most annoying moose sound after every track), one very sweet and tiny little old lady and still feel content. </p>

<div class="author_meta">01 Mar 2005</div>
<p>Ok, not to totally contradict my last post, I’ve just read a comedy web page all about me that was put up 5 years ago which I never knew existed! You might like to take a look <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/presence/dj.htm">here</a>. It seems my music tastes haven’t changed all that much, as the songs I quote are all still top tunes…I may of gotten all technical for no reason.</p>

<h1><a href="/2005/02/27/emotional-music">Emotional Music</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">27 Feb 2005</div>
<p>I’m finding quite a lot at the moment that my music stirs up far more emotion in me than ever before. I don’t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is “all about the music”. Tim’s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that? (There’s another amazing quirk God’s blessed man with). I also heard that as your body ages, your ear becomes more succeptable to particular frequencies, possibly causing some kind of change in our musical tastes, due to some frequencies being more common in particular pieces of music. (I have no way of backing that up, so any medics might not like to ever bring that up in conversation with me). All this is a round about way of saying I think my music tastes have matured as I’ve got older…who’d of thought eh?</p>

<h1><a href="/2005/02/21/fun-packed-weekends">Fun Packed Weekends</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">21 Feb 2005</div>
<p>My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It’s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.</p>

<p>This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis’s in Swansea for a bit to say hi. We spent the afternoon shopping at Tesco’s and choosing each other’s various toiletry related items! Great chance to see where she’s been living (pretty much across the road from where she did previously), hang out and watch trashy tv with one another (Go Chunk).</p>

<p>I spent monday over at Viv’s “Chocolate Evening” with her and Zoe watching Dodgeball, which was a laugh a minute… I think I’d been on a bit of a downer that day and thats just what I needed. I think it might of been a slight overkill on the chocolate though.</p>

<p>Thursday was of course my first appearance under my dj pseudonym “Scrumpy Jack” (keeping it real – from my roots of Somerset), I was a bit unimpressed by my performance, no matter what mates say, but it was cool to play in the Welsh club – what a “proper” club should be. This kind of inspired me to knock out a mix (one of the longest I’ve done in a while) on Saturday afternoon. I might shove it somewhere on the web if I can find a suitable place. Dodgy in places, but I don’t really care as I hadn’t prepared at all for it.</p>

<p>Checked out the “off the shelf” guys on Friday night – some mad jungle biznis till late into the night. Yesterday evening involved building a large fire on the beach and some random plank walking over it by peeps. Very nice evening, moonlit beach all to ourselves, extremely cool. The highlight of the evening had to be Carl and Meilyr running away from a random welsh guys car after checking that he hadn’t rigged up some sophisticated suicide routine while we’d been in the pub, and had actually just fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Next week I’m off to see the parentals in Yeovil, which is nice…..</p>
