      <div class="author_meta">01 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I&#8217;d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it&#8217;s quite the opposite really.</p>
<p>My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it&#8217;s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase. If you download or copy cd&#8217;s with no intention of rewarding those who created it with payment of some way shape or form, I&#8217;m sorry, I really can&#8217;t see it as a good thing. You might argue that fat cats mark up media with artificially high prices, with little going to the original artists, but it&#8217;s untrue for the most part (there are a huge number of people involved in producing most albums) and goes a short way as to why you should award those artists with no payment whatsoever&#8230;these artists do after all sign contracts and know what they&#8217;re getting themselves into for the most part.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are occasions where my opinions blur. In the case of mix cd&#8217;s, I see the cd as a showcase for the DJ&#8217;s mixing skills, as well as those songs upon it, so I&#8217;d quite happily download mixes from the net. If there is a good track within, I&#8217;ll add it to my collection anyway, the majority of the dance music scene seems to encourage these methods anyway &#8211; getting their artists to produce mixes and distribute them online so people buy the bare, unmixed, tracks. It gets really messy with the issue of sampling &#8211; I&#8217;m not even going there&#8230;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a little more scary, is the attitude Christians take to piracy. I&#8217;ve known in the past Christians quite happily pirating software worth thousands to produce albums or websites for projects in the Church, with little or no concern for what they&#8217;re doing. Surely there&#8217;s something wrong there &#8211; making Church websites with stolen software? The majority of the time its simply not necessary for the tasks in hand either, there are other ways of achieving the results in a more ethical way. (Ask me if you want to know how)&#8230; I&#8217;m probably more sensitive in this area, due to the fact I create software myself.</p>
<p>I was really disturbed when I first got into sharing applications as a teenager at the volume of Christian music available, Delerious, Redman, Jars of Clay, you want it its there&#8230;it seems we&#8217;re just as bad as the rest of the world here. The Gospel Music Association even has the stats to <a href="http://www.cmta.com/research.htm" title="GMA">prove it</a>. The Bible calls for us to &#8216;abide by the laws of the land&#8217; because such authorities &#8216;have been established by God&#8217; (Romans 13:1-7) &#8211; if we&#8217;re going against them we&#8217;re going against God. I can&#8217;t see that laws for copyrighting music, films go against what God says, so really we have no reason for being so lax in this department.</p>
<p>I was reading a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0851112587/qid%3D1122935165/026-6844478-8087659" title="Amazon">Net Commandments</a> back along which describes how easy technology has made it for us to sin (or cybersin &#8211; but that sounds like you need a peripheral). Not only this, but its also removed a large majority of the barriers which have been in place which otherwise may have presented us from sinning. I&#8217;d love to see some of us going into Virgin and using our MD to record the album we&#8217;re sampling at the listening point, it&#8217;d never happen.</p>

          <p>So, in the absence of students, life continues as normal for the various research teams down here in the Queens buildings. We wake, march to University and sit in our little boxes reading, theorising and tearing our hair out until 5 o&#8217;clock when we march back, only to be repeated the next day. I hate routines&#8230;</p>
<p>Today marked the graduation of Year 3&#8242;s which brought back memories of my graduation last year, which was pretty depressing to be honest. It allows me to reflect how far I&#8217;ve come in the last year or so and how I&#8217;ve not nearly amounted to that image I&#8217;d be content with at the beginning of my degree and how perhaps my values have changed. It also made me to look at how much older I am than the vast majority of my colleagues and how different life would have been coming to uni a year earlier. I know the whole experience of that extra couple of years at home was beneficial to me and I was placed there for a reason, but it doesn&#8217;t half make me feel inadequate against some of my current pool of mates. This combined with the current lack of air conditioning in our lab and mini-heatwave (we reached 33 degrees) doesn&#8217;t make it easy to keep to any train of thought for extended periods.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder where I&#8217;ll be in the next year&#8230;.</p>
<p>Oh &#8211; I know! &#8230;&#8230;. right here sat at my desk</p>

      <div class="author_meta">07 Jul 2005</div>

          <p>It&#8217;s been a good week thus far. Saturday marked a return to Somerset to attend Steve and Hannah&#8217;s wedding, which I was a little late for due to having to pick up a number of interesting things I&#8217;ve been given by Gran. I felt a little harsh having to dash in, collect and leave, it felt a little like Dad and I were looting the place.</p>
<p>Being late was ok as one of the speakers was following in just after me (apparently a bit of a search was going on for him prior to the service), confirming we were good to creep through the large arched doors as the sound of singing could be heard. I&#8217;m getting more impressed with my homing skills for places I don&#8217;t know (though I couldn&#8217;t really go far wrong with a village the size of Yetminster). It was really cool meeting lots of people I haven&#8217;t seen for ages from yesteryear in YCC and catching up, plus being with the Yeovil posse again.</p>
<p>After juggling antics in France, I thought it would be quite cool to re-live childhood fun and decided to bring up my unicycle &#8216;The Undercarriage Chaifer&#8217; too. After returning to Cardiff saturday after the wedding, I had to move stuff back in trying not to annoy &#8216;Ellie&#8217; &#8211; the new housemate who I&#8217;d never met before. This was more difficult than it sounds, everyone in bed and me trying to move a freezer across the street into the house quietly at 1:30am is unsurprisingly fairly difficult.</p>
<p>Sunday helralded cleaning of said freezer and assembling of unicycle, before going to play in the park with guys on the latter. Tim said my task was to be juggling and unicycling simultaneously by the end of the hour. After a few, slow and short free-mounts I was able to continue back to the house. Talks this week have revealed said housemate is up on circus skills too, so a worthy addition to the house.</p>
<p>Today holds the best news though. It marks the 13 month voyage Tim and I have taken to get our bonds from year 2003-2004 back minus only &pound;1 each for the non-cleaning of window sills in the lounge (which everyone knows is still a hangable offence in some countries) and a further &pound;20 for Tims amusing &#8216;I think I&#8217;ll mop this water off the carpet with the iron&#8217; incident. It&#8217;s the end of an era.  </p>

      <div class="author_meta">29 Jun 2005</div>

          <p>Today I travelled on 2 planes, 3 buses and 1 car (thats a full house and extra) to make the 800 mile round trip to Edinburgh for part of a <a href="http://www.bdworld.org">BioDiveristyWorld</a> conference. I&#8217;m quite surprised I managed to organise and sort out everything since Monday and it go according to plan.</p>
<p>I was actually really overwhelmed at how amazing the place was for the brief time I was there, the sheer scale of the city was something else. Too bad I couldn&#8217;t stick about for the G8 conference and related protests/festivals, despite comments about riots being thrown around, it would of been something to tell the kids. Anyways, I&#8217;ve got Steve and Hannah&#8217;s wedding back home to go to on Saturday. The 5:00am start has not been the best thing for me though, I will sleep like the proverbial log tonight.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">28 Jun 2005</div>

          <p>I forgot to write a classic quote I found in &#8216;Boy&#8217; while I was away so I thought I&#8217;d shove it up now. I think it encompasses how I feel about work at the moment. Really enjoyed just lazing about reading in France for ages, finished Pi, although I found it to drag on somewhat, the quirky bit at the end made it fairly clever. Onto some Pratchett now after resisiting for ages. Anyways, here you go..</p>
<p>&#8216;The life of a writer is absolute hell compared with the life of a businessman. The writer has to force himself to go to work. He has to make his own hours and if he doesn&#8217;t go to his desk at all there is nobody there to scold him. If he is a writer of fiction he lives in a world of fear. Each new day demands new ideas* and he can never be sure whether he is going to come up with them or not. Two hours of writing fiction leaves this particular writer absolutely drained. For those two hours he has been miles away, he has been somewhere else, in a different place with totally different people, and the effort of swimming back into normal surroundings is very great. It is almost a shock. The writer walks out of his workroom in a daze. He wants a drink. He needs it. It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him. He does it to give himself faith, hope and courage. A person is a fool to become a writer. His only compensation is absolute freedom. He has no master except his own soul*, and that I&#8217;m sure, is why he does it.&#8217;</p>
<p>*I&#8217;d say this goes for non-fiction too&#8230;</p>
<p>*Except of course if he subscribes to one of a number of religions&#8230;..or in Pi&#8217;s case, a number of religions</p>
