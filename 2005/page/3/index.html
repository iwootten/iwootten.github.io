          <p>I found a wicked animation by Maria Claudia Cortes describing what personalities a bunch of colours are often attributed with. I reckon I&#8217;m a mixture of red and blue, my wardrobe reflects this as well. <a href="http://www.mariaclaudiacortes.com/">What colour are you?</a></p>

          <p>Whats the most annoying thing ebuyer could leave out of my order for my building a new PC? That&#8217;s it &#8211; the OS, so I can build my lovely little machine, but not actually use the thing until they get their act together. Nice one guys, you <a href="http://www.ebuyersucks.com">suck ass</a>.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve always bought lots of music. Those of you who&#8217;ve had the privilege of viewing my collection will have seen it spans all manner of media, Tape, CD, MD, Vinyl. I&#8217;ve recently been doing a lot of random browsing on ebay for CD&#8217;s that have previously escaped me and possibly buying a few other items from the same seller to save on postage. My biggest one though has to be my most recent, 12 albums from the same seller. It&#8217;s allowed me to reminice the awesome Orb, along with Orbital, Goldie and earlier William Orbit albums whilst exploring a bunch of cheesy trance as well. All for the bargain price of &pound;17! &#8211; a sum which I may have paid for a single album in the past. My how times change&#8230;</p>
<p>My latest favourite ol&#8217; electronica hit as a result is &#8220;Orb &#8211; Little Fluffy Clouds&#8221;.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;m feeling rather fragile at the moment, which is really annoying because the majority of the time I&#8217;m the picture of health. It started yesterday, but I thought I&#8217;d got over it only for headaches and tummy aches to return by the evening. Unfortunately, it meant I wasn&#8217;t best of hosts to Hannah who stayed over on Sunday because of a stereophonics gig she was going to. I had to fix her up with Jon to go with as her mate decided to back out on her pretty late. Hannah got a few odd looks at the prospect of her taking her inflatable guitar though.. </p>
<p>Todays been enrolment, which is just a pain as well due to central being at talybont and departmental being down in Queens. I think I must have been quite out of it as I just randomly decided to queue with people in trevithick, until realising that actually my enrolment was in a completely different building and had been every year I&#8217;d been there.</p>
<p>Theres noticeably more students around here and less parking spaces. So much so as some old welsh coot decided to give me verbal for no apparent reason outside my house. I won&#8217;t describe in detail what happened but suffice to say he was obviously mad. Anyways, I guess there&#8217;ll be more of that in the pipeline over the coming year&#8230;</p>

          <p>I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don&#8217;t think is interesting at all, but I&#8217;ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others. This perhaps gives a few insights as to why my blogging doesn&#8217;t occur as often as those who feel it neccessary to pour out their innermost thoughts every day, or maybe I don&#8217;t have enough of them to warrant talking about&#8230;</p>
