      <description>I&amp;#8217;m finding quite a lot at the moment that my music stirs up far more emotion in me than ever before. I don&amp;#8217;t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is &amp;#8220;all about the music&amp;#8221;. Tim&amp;#8217;s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that?</description>

      <description>My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It&amp;#8217;s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.
This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis&amp;#8217;s in Swansea for a bit to say hi.</description>
