I don’t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is “all about the music”. Tim’s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that?</description></item><item><title>Fun Packed Weekends</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/02/21/fun-packed-weekends/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/02/21/fun-packed-weekends/</guid><description>My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It’s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.
This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis’s in Swansea for a bit to say hi.</description></item><item><title>Scrumpy Jack gig</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/02/09/scrumpy-jack-gig/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Feb 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/02/09/scrumpy-jack-gig/</guid><description>I’ve got my first ‘proper’ gig in Cardiff next week, supporting the mighty ‘Eberg’ at Clwb Ifor Bach.
