        <p>I&#8217;m feeling rather fragile at the moment, which is really annoying because the majority of the time I&#8217;m the picture of health. It started yesterday, but I thought I&#8217;d got over it only for headaches and tummy aches to return by the evening. Unfortunately, it meant I wasn&#8217;t best of hosts to Hannah who stayed over on Sunday because of a stereophonics gig she was going to. I had to fix her up with Jon to go with as her mate decided to back out on her pretty late. Hannah got a few odd looks at the prospect of her taking her inflatable guitar though.. </p>
<p>Todays been enrolment, which is just a pain as well due to central being at talybont and departmental being down in Queens. I think I must have been quite out of it as I just randomly decided to queue with people in trevithick, until realising that actually my enrolment was in a completely different building and had been every year I&#8217;d been there.</p>
<p>Theres noticeably more students around here and less parking spaces. So much so as some old welsh coot decided to give me verbal for no apparent reason outside my house. I won&#8217;t describe in detail what happened but suffice to say he was obviously mad. Anyways, I guess there&#8217;ll be more of that in the pipeline over the coming year&#8230;</p>
