    <p>I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don’t think is interesting at all, but I’ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others. This perhaps gives a few insights as to why my blogging doesn’t occur as often as those who feel it neccessary to pour out their innermost thoughts every day, or maybe I don’t have enough of them to warrant talking about…</p>
