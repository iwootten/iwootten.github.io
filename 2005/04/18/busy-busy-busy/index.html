        <p>I&#8217;ve been running around a bit like a headless chicken recently, not content with spending lots of time at uni working, I&#8217;ve been partying pretty hard as well. </p>
<p>Spent Friday going to Kez&#8217;s 21st birthday for a meal at Old Orleans, which was rather tasty. Bombed back to hang out with Vineyardites at Marty&#8217;z Kitchen, which we were duely moved on from to Cafe aroma, and back to mine (after a few choice insults were uttered by me) for a nice cuppa. After that, decided to go on to Sumo at the Welsh club with Aquasky and Masterblaster, once again having a fab time on my own and dancing about like a loon with drunks I don&#8217;t know. Bit of a late one was that &#8211; arriving back for 4. </p>
<p>After project meetings on Saturday to discuss our trip today with the other half of the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="PASOA">PASOA</a> project in Southampton, I didn&#8217;t have time to attend a bar-b I&#8217;d been invited too, and instead went straight over to Jon and Cathy&#8217;s for rather random games evening with lots of lego and frustrating &#8220;Guess Who&#8221; games. I was a tad upset to find that after nipping to the loo, all my passengers had defected to the dark side by going back with Jennie &#8211; the cheek! After confronting her on Sunday she also announced she&#8217;d stolen my aerial off my car! Gah!</p>
<p>All in all a fab weekend, though I don&#8217;t think I could keep it up every week.</p>
<p>Note to self 1: Games where I (or as a member of a team, ahem &#8211; Rob) lose, are rubbish, especially played against girls. That&#8217;s probably why I enjoy playing shoot-em-ups offline (or against Tim).</p>
<p>Note to self 2: Don&#8217;t go calling the children of your Church leaders names, not even in jest, it has a habit of getting back to them.</p>
