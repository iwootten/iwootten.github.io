      <div class="author_meta">16 May 2009</div>

          <p>I don&#8217;t particularly like using URL shortening services. I think I first noticed them getting used rather prolificly in the Guardians technology section to include lots of random links to bizarre web content. <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL&#8217;s own web site</a> wouldn&#8217;t particularly inspire me to go ahead and make use of it either. But, because of <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">my own use</a> of services such as twitter, I&#8217;m forced to shrink down links to get within those 144 characters.</p>
<p>Herein lies a problem &#8211; If said URL shortening service disappears, all my links are broken to all that interesting content I worked so hard to find. Not good.</p>
<p>In order to our bit to help, <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">a</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/?start=10">number</a> <a href="http://www.colly.com/comments/ee_shortener_plugin_your_own_short_urls_using_revcanonical_and_permanent_re/">of</a> <a href="http://bokardo.com/">developers</a> and even <a href="http://baconfile.com/">services</a> have taken action in order to make sure they provide alternatives for the links over which they&#8217;re responsible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://whomwah.com/2009/04/14/revcanonical-a-revcanonical-wordpress-plugin/">installed a plugin here</a> which uses the recently puchased domain &#8220;<a href="http://woot10.eu">woot10.eu</a>&#8221; to provide alternative links using the code <code>&lt;link rev=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;shorter link&quot; /&gt;</code>. My full ianwootten.co.uk domain does not lend itself well to be able to provide a shorter URL on the same domain unforunately.</p>
<p>There is a whole huge discussion on the approriateness of using this technique (mainly) due to the rev attribute not being included in the HTML5 spec. See the comments in <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/save-the-internet-with-rev-canonical">Chris Shifletts post</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>Anyway, Duncans plugin takes the id of any wordpress post and coverts it to base 36 (instead of 10) and offers up the alternative in the header of each post. I believe the conversion could go all the way up to 62, if php&#8217;s base conversion actually supported the use of different cases in conversion.</p>
<p>In my own case, I&#8217;ve had to forward the links from woot10.eu across to www.ianwootten.co.uk using a .htaccess file so that the plugin is actually able to pick them up.</p>
<p>Now when you visit:</p>
<p><code>http://woot10.eu/p8p</code> you&#8217;ll be forwarded on to the longer URL such as <code>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/05/15/my-vicious-circle-of-posting-quality-content</code>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t particularly useful if you want to find the alternative for URL, as you&#8217;ll have to hunt through the source of a post. For that I&#8217;d suggest <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">Simons bookmarklet</a> which looks for an alternative link, or creates one if it doesn&#8217;t exist using tinyurl. As an aside, there looks to be an interesting talk on the canonical attribute and link element by Matt Cutts of google <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm9onOGTgeM">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 May 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been looking back at the posts on this site and the commitment that I supposedly made (internally) a couple of months ago about posting regular, interesting content. But it seemed to die a death very promptly.</p>
<p>I think that there may be a bit of a vicious circle here (in my own situation at least). I&#8217;d love to post regular interesting stuff, but for that to happen I need to feel that it might be read. By far the most commented stuff here is when I link up code. Those posts take a fairly substantial amount of time for me to complete as they are born of the result of my own frustration of hours spent tinkering with code, which I think might be useful for others to be clued up on. I also need time to gather my thoughts and structure what exactly I&#8217;m trying to say to people. This all adds up.</p>
<p>If I post more often, I fear the lesser quality of content might be pretty boring for the majority of people and probably not at all worthy of feedback from them. So I end up in a kind of stalemate position &#8211; should I post this/shouldn&#8217;t I/Oo-er and I don&#8217;t do anything. I&#8217;m not saying that I have a massive amount of visitors here, I&#8217;d just like them to enjoy the experience when they visit.</p>
