For the uninitiated, it allows you to list short updates of what you are doing at any time. BBC News seemed to have an all-out assault at the end of January raving about it at every opportunity – <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7834755.stm>the first moments of the Hudson plane landing</a>, an short chat about it by Stephen Fry on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and <a href=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7845823.stm>this short clip on iPlayer</a> by <a href=http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/2009/01/29/twitter/>Stephen Fry again</a>. For Stephen Fry, this has meant an insane amount of new followers, indicated by the stats by twittercounter, which are shown below.</p><p><a href=http://twittercounter.com/stephenfry/month></a></p><p>Notice the stats for 27th January – a full 20,978 extra followers in a single day! My <a href=http://twitter.com/ironyboy>own profile</a> has a paltry 38 in comparison for all time!, which is about 30 more friends than I actually have offline…</p><p>I guess this huge upsurge is in part due to the fact that Stephen is such a well known comedian in the UK and by no means a stranger to the web. Just yesterday <a href=http://www.kottke.org/09/02/stephen-fry-stuck-in-elevator-twittering>Jason Kottke observed his day as deciding “to start his own reality chat show after becoming stuck in an elevator”</a>. He also has an <a href=http://stephenfry.com>awesome blog</a> and <a href=http://www.stephenfry.com/media/audio/109/series-2-episode-3--language/>podcast</a>. He also is a very open advocate of <a href=http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu.html>open source</a> and free software. How on earth he finds the time to live both his life virtually and as television celebrity I do not know. But I like the cut of his jib.</p><p>It seems micro-blogging is truly being picked up by the masses. I really enjoy it, but ideally I’d love to be using a decentralised open source service, hosted on my own personal webspace. I’d like to suggest the Open Micro Blogging service, <a href=http://laconi.ca>laconi.ca</a> as the way forward – but then I also want to be able to reply to my friends on twitter and them to me and I don’t think true two way cross network chat will happen for a while. I see <a href=http://wordpress.org>wordpress</a> to <a href=http://blogger.com>blogger</a> as <a href=http://laconi.ca>laconi.ca</a> is to <a href=http://twitter.com>twitter</a>. I’m actually surprised that there doesn’t seem to be a concerted effort from any one of the current big blog companies right now to push for a more open alternative. The automatticians have put out <a href=http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/>prologue</a> but it doesn’t seem to have been touched for over a year and only supports sharing amongst groups (as in a working environment)…that’s no fun for the rest of us.</p><p>Bring on a true open web status service, (complete with adopters) where I can update any one of my friends on my activities by them following a status feed on my homepage and vice versa. This requires clients who make use of such services though and right now twitter is stronger in that regard.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/01/31/are-music-blogs-getting-a-raw-deal/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
