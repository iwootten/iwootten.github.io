          <h1><a href="/2009/02/15/how-has-web-use-changed-your-life">How has web use changed your life?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">15 Feb 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been pondering this morning how the use of the internet has (or may have) changed my life. As a child/teen during the web&#8217;s infancy, I was blissfully unaware that so many lifes/careers/relationships would be enabled or changed as a result of the interactions it might facilitate. I hadn&#8217;t even heard of google prior to arriving at university and two years prior to that had never had internet access anywhere locally.<br>I am sure my behaviour today would be pretty different if the web wasn&#8217;t around due to the massive impact its had in my world view. It seems a far smaller place and more tightly coupled. I feel free to drop messages to strangers and write blog posts into the ether. I won a T4 competition in my early uni years which landed me a car and Â£4k richer, which I wouldn&#8217;t have entered if I&#8217;d had to phone &#8211; so I&#8217;d definitely be poorer. There are however, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6187554.stm">examples</a> where the use of the web has had a detrimental effect on particular individual lives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge one to think about. Would my life be better as a result of the web having not been so widely adopted in the way it has? Would yours?</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/02/06/stephen-fry-and-the-ascent-of-micro-blogging">Stephen Fry and the Ascent of &quot;Micro Blogging&quot;</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">06 Feb 2009</div>

          <p><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is all over the news at the moment. For the uninitiated, it allows you to list short updates of what you are doing at any time. BBC News seemed to have an all-out assault at the end of January raving about it at every opportunity &#8211; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7834755.stm">the first moments of the Hudson plane landing</a>, an short chat about it by Stephen Fry on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7845823.stm">this short clip on iPlayer</a> by <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/2009/01/29/twitter/">Stephen Fry again</a>. For Stephen Fry, this has meant an insane amount of new followers, indicated by the stats by twittercounter, which are shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://twittercounter.com/stephenfry/month"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/stephenfry-twitcount-300x236.gif" alt="Stephenfry&#039;s Twittercounter" title="Stephenfry Twittercounter" width="300" height="236" class="size-medium wp-image-302" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the stats for 27th January &#8211; a full 20,978 extra followers in a single day! My <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">own profile</a> has a paltry 38 in comparison for all time!, which is about 30 more friends than I actually have offline&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess this huge upsurge is in part due to the fact that Stephen is such a well known comedian in the UK and by no means a stranger to the web. Just yesterday <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/02/stephen-fry-stuck-in-elevator-twittering">Jason Kottke observed his day as deciding &#8220;to start his own reality chat show after becoming stuck in an elevator&#8221;</a>. He also has an <a href="http://stephenfry.com">awesome blog</a> and <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/media/audio/109/series-2-episode-3--language/">podcast</a>. He also is a very open advocate of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu.html">open source</a> and free software. How on earth he finds the time to live both his life virtually and as television celebrity I do not know. But I like the cut of his jib.</p>
<p>It seems micro-blogging is truly being picked up by the masses. I really enjoy it, but ideally I&#8217;d love to be using a decentralised open source service, hosted on my own personal webspace. I&#8217;d like to suggest the Open Micro Blogging service, <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> as the way forward &#8211; but then I also want to be able to reply to my friends on twitter and them to me and I don&#8217;t think true two way cross network chat will happen for a while. I see <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> to <a href="http://blogger.com">blogger</a> as <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> is to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. I&#8217;m actually surprised that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a concerted effort from any one of the current big blog companies right now to push for a more open alternative. The automatticians have put out <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">prologue</a> but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been touched for over a year and only supports sharing amongst groups (as in a working environment)&#8230;that&#8217;s no fun for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Bring on a true open web status service, (complete with adopters) where I can update any one of my friends on my activities by them following a status feed on my homepage and vice versa. This requires clients who make use of such services though and right now twitter is stronger in that regard.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/01/31/are-music-blogs-getting-a-raw-deal">Are Music Blogs getting a Raw Deal?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">31 Jan 2009</div>

          <p>I can&#8217;t help but feel a little sorry for music blogs as of late. I&#8217;m sure you may be familiar with <a href="http://hypem.com">The Hype Machine</a> and may use it on a daily basis. For the uninitiated, it is essentially a music blog aggregator, which takes details of tracks and ranks them based on how often they appear and how popular they are. I&#8217;ve found it really interesting to browse around and discover new artists.</p>
<p>However, lately I&#8217;ve been wondering if these blogs are getting a raw deal. From my own personal experience, I can say that recommending music takes a lot of time and effort, especially if you decide to go into detail about your choices. Often, the recommendations which the Hype Machine scans are sourced from <a href="http://soul-sides.com/2009/01/spinners-spin-with-me.html">long</a> <a href="http://discontentblog.com/?p=313">detailed</a> <a href="http://electrorash.com/touch-typist/">blog posts</a>, which I&#8217;d say were put together to provide some context for why the author made those choices on any particular day. These aren&#8217;t put up quickly without little thought. However, I generally never look at these posts when listening to music from the hype machine, as I&#8217;m after that next great track fix. I can&#8217;t imagine that these blogs get much traffic that translates into loyal visitors from the machine. I&#8217;ve previously also heard that many of these blogs get a huge amount of their bandwidth eaten up from the number of downloads/streaming they get as a result. I don&#8217;t know who is to blame here, or if indeed this problem exists, whether the blogs are providing unneccessary background information or getting good results from the machine, but I still feel a little sorry for them all the same.</p>
<p>[Update 2/2/08: One thing I forgot to mention here is that there are alternative services offering a different way of providing music recommendations. I recently discovered the <a href="http://peoplesmusicstore.com">Peoples Music Store</a> which allows users to make music recommendations within their own unique stores. The users get 10% of the sale if people decide to purchase from their stores. I really like the idea, but I&#39;d imagine people might take these recommendations and purchase somewhere cheaper, like amazon.]</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/01/29/what-do-i-have-to-contribute">What do I have to contribute?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">29 Jan 2009</div>

          <p>It has struck me over the last couple of days and it&#8217;s a reflection of my attitude to being interested in geeky things in general. I&#8217;m an elitist. When I started my blog back in 2003, I loved the fact that relatively few of them existed. It was a reflection of my day to day life and I felt my voice was being heard (even though I had no analytics tools to back that up and it was not particularly interesting).</p>
<p>Back then, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started out</a> on <a href="http://movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a> and quickly moved it over to <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2/cafelog</a>, which later grew into <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Fast forward 5 years to now and every manner of blog subject exists, whilst in the meantime my own seems to have fallen into a state of disrepair. </p>
<p>I think my blogs&#8217; own slowdown has occurred because blogging about day to day life is not so much fun now &#8211; I&#8217;m no longer unique as I was in terms of the technical ability of being able to output my thoughts. Anyone can start a blog, <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblelog</a>, <a href="http://sweetcron.com">lifestream</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">twitter</a> account and use it to expose their daily activity online. They need to know nothing, or very little at all about how the back end works. So I&#8217;m now left thinking, what do I have to contribute in all this? </p>
<p>My own PhD research has had little exposure here, where if I had chosen to air my thoughts, it might be continuing in new directions from discussion which may have opened up around it. Instead, it is hidden away in research papers and closed forums which an average joe may never come across.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proposing that I push to air my thoughts on all manner of subject here over the coming year, as well as my usual day-to-day activity. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be contributing something new, something interesting, something playing on my mind and which I want to discuss with each post. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d join me for the ride and I promise I won&#8217;t be at all elitist.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">13 Jan 2009</div>

          <p>It seems that all I do these days is talk about what&#8217;s going on over at <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and if you&#8217;re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I&#8217;ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what&#8217;s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re holding our <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com/challenge/fairytales">second design challenge</a> right now and calling for designs based around the concept of a unique twist on a fairy tale. The prize is our biggest ever, at Â£200 + a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS3 (which was kindly donated by one of F&#038;B&#8217;s community!). You have until 15th February to both submit a design and get it voted on by the F&#038;B peeps!</p>
<p>It looks like I&#8217;ve also failed to mention over here the winner of our Snowdodgers competition as the amazing <a href="http://www.mistershrew.co.uk">Mister Shrew</a>. The shirts we printed look amazing and you should pick one up now if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
