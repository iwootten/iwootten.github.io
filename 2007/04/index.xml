      <description>Browsing across Matt Westcotts site yielded this particular gem. [I&amp;rsquo;m from there don&amp;rsquo;t you know?]. I used to love tracking it up in fasttracker, but haven&amp;#8217;t done anything for a very, very long time. Maybe I should start experimenting again&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Did you know that not only can http://rightmove.co.uk hunt down all the prices of current houses for sale in your area, it will also give you the prices that houses have gone for for the last 7 years? I didn&amp;#8217;t, but tonight I enjoyed checking out the fact that someone bought a house in my road for &amp;pound;40k in January (but I think either this is a typo, or the place is a hole!</description>

      <description>This afternoon I was quite chuffed to discover that I&amp;#8217;d been selected for a Joost beta invite. Joost is, in a nutshell, TV for the web . Kind of the opposite to that Current TV channel on Virgin Media. I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with it this evening, mainly perusing the XL-Recordings and gaming channels.It all seems very good &amp;#8211; a good seelction of channels (for me) straight off, with the ability to search Joost&amp;#8217;s catalog of channels and add more to your collection.</description>
