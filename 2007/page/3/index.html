      <div class="author_meta">08 Aug 2007</div>

          <p>Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of <a href="http://carsonified.com">Ryan Carsons</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Applications</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/raodtrip">Roadtrip</a>. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down. Luckily, at about 6.30pm the line opened up again and I made it over to Bristol. I&#8217;d met up with Evan Rudowski and Jo(?) of <a href="http://www.subhub.com">SubHub</a> prior at Cardiff station and therefore headed over with them.</p>
<p>It was a good evening, with me able to catch up with <a href="http://jontangerine.com">Jon</a> and <a href="http://dotjay.co.uk">Jon</a> of the <a href="http://gr0w.com">Grow Collective</a> (with whom I shall hopefully be working with very soon, but more on that later). I don&#8217;t think I ever used the free drink I was entitled too with my lovely check sticker Ryan graced me with. A similar event is happening in Cardiff on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip">10th September over in the bay</a>, if you&#8217;re a web type in wales you&#8217;d probably do well to check it out.</p>
<p>Update: there&#8217;s more info on the event on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/thanks-bristol/">Future of Web Apps blog</a>. I even made it into a couple of photos, albeit adorning a rucksack. The fire in Newport <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6936270.stm">completely destroyed a row of houses</a>. I guess I didn&#8217;t have it that bad&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">22 Jul 2007</div>

          <p>Now that the big day has passed, I thought I&#8217;d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is <a href="http://www.goape.co.uk/">Go Ape</a>. This was really great fun and definitely a little different than some of the other stag do&#8217;s I&#8217;ve been on. Basically, you attach yourself to a steel rope and move through a bunch of trees high up, except the route taken might not be as straight forward as a bridge. Give it a try, it defintely was worth the money&#8230; I also highly recommend watching the videos below for an idea of the action.</p>
<p>On the saturday afternoon, we travelled to er, somewhere to have a go at shooting some stuff. Don&#8217;t worry, it wasn&#8217;t ever alive. Well, you obviously need to know how to operate a 12 gauge before you get married, surely? The chap guiding us was a Lord and seemed rather keen on letting us all know about it, also how Nelson Mandela was a terrorist and he&#8217;d put him away, nice&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway following an evening on the town due to being kicked out of our new pad for the girls to take over, Sunday we met up with the hen do to have a fairly surprisingly decent day at the beach (people even burnt!). Some people decided to bury me in rocks&#8230;but Viv rescued me. As people decided to head off, I was quite chuffed I&#8217;d got away without anything dodgy going down.</p>

          <p>Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&#8217;s never had a home before and we&#8217;ve never owned it. Anyway, suffice to say things are busy &#8211; which might explain my not being about. Sorry if you feel you&#8217;ve been missing out&#8230;</p>
