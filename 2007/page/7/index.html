          <p>pMachine has changed its name to <a href="http://ellislab.com">Ellislab</a>, and are <a href="http://ellislab.com">sporting a shiny new website for all to see</a>. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don&#8217;t fall under the same banner now. I&#8217;m glad to see that the <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> website has got a facelift. <a href="http://31three.com/">31three</a> did the hard graft on the design and <a href="http://ellislab.com">they</a> all <a href="http://expressionengine.com">look</a> <a href="http://codeigniter.com">awesome</a>.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2007/03/08/openid-the-end-of-multiple-passwords">OpenID - The end of multiple passwords?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">08 Mar 2007</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been hearing some really good stuff about <a href="http://openid.net">openID</a> recently. For those who don&#8217;t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It&#8217;s recently risen to light with the adoption by <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/03/06/openid/">WordPress.com</a> as a provider and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/20/kevin-rose-at-fowa-digg-adopts-openid/">digg</a> as an adopter.<a href="http://webwebusability.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/wordpress-openid-not-really/">Complaints</a> against wordpress.com&#8217;s non-allowance of logins with openID&#8217;s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded. For those whom wordpress.com is not their original openID provider, it means that creation of these accounts will go unused and the identity problem seems to be perpetuated somewhat. If you do have your own domain, you can go ahead and <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/03/07/use-your-own-url-not-wordpresscoms-as-your-openid">create your own openID account there</a>, but you won&#8217;t be able to sign into wordpress.com with it.I had an idea off of the back of coming up with a memorable name for an application which makes use of openID as I read this this morning, but after a look around, it seems its <a href="http://fabricoffolly.blogspot.com/2007/03/to-z-of-online-profile-aggregators.html">already been done to death</a>. Alas, this is always the way. The offering by the PhD students over at <a href="http://claimid.com">claimID</a> looks great and is just the sort of thing I&#8217;ve been looking for. I may give it a bash at some point, although someones comment that it looked too much like &#8220;chlamydia.com&#8221;, probably would put me off putting it down on a cv.There&#8217;s lots of useful examples and information at <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/">openID enabled</a>. You can see a short (5 min) video about openID <a href="http://ignitenight.blip.tv/file/154407/">here</a>, presented by Scott Kveton, CEO of <a href="http://janrain.com/">JanRain</a>, who build identity services for the web.</p>

          <p>Did you not know? I&#8217;m going to hit the grand old age of 26 soon. Whooah, thats like ancient. If you want some ideas of what you can get me (I obviously expect a gift), why not check my gift list <a href="http://gifttagging.com/scrumpyjack">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2ZGQU6TDBXOYL/203-4356029-7279932">here</a>, to save the embarrasment of some really awful gift.</p>

          <p>This link sent to me by Lewis made me laugh quite a lot. Funnily, it looks a lot like him with a wig on.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2007/02/20/here-comes-the-fuzz">Here comes the Fuzz</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">20 Feb 2007</div>

          <p>Tonight, Cineworld gave us tickets free to any film of our choice when we were meant to be seeing a preview, due to a cock up at their end. I already knew what it would be without looking at what was out, Hot Fuzz. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve loved Simon Pegg ever since the days of Big Train, when humour was just so completely random it had to be funny. Shaun of the Dead had some great random moments in it, but I left it feeling that it wasn&#8217;t the best I&#8217;d come to expect. Hot Fuzz however is a great take on an altogether different genre, although you might not be able to tell from the gore levels it dishes out. Apparently it was filmed in Wells in Somerset, which actually is the smallest city in England and my home county. The uniforms they wore confused the locals who thought they were real policemen. Obviously nobody watches spoof zombie movies down there except me and a few others. If you&#8217;re looking for an action-packed bloody comedy, get down to your local cinema already.</p>
