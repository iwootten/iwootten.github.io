          <p>I&#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&#8217;ll be rewarded. It&#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the <a href="http://www.xen10.com">small hosting company</a> that I&#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.</p>
<p>Today, one of my favourite breaks record labels (Marine Parade) were offering a compo to win a cd by responding to them over myspace. (Ok, maybe a somewhat less grandiose scenario than this post may have made out, but still!) I&#8217;ve long refused to sign up to myspace out of principles (it looks bloody awful, mainly) so I sent them a message to point it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to respond to get the cd via myspace, I feel I shouldn&#8217;t have to be forced to use that poor excuse for an interweb page.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is my address just in case you feel like sending me Adam Freelands &#8211; Tectonics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my joy, they didn&#8217;t care!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fair enough, you get one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever won a competition due to principles. Maybe I should start bending the rules of other competitions and still try to win prizes?</p>

          <p>Today on the return from uni I passed the new Subway that is opening up soon near Queen Street train station. On one of their job adverts, they were advertising for team leaders and <em>sandwich artists</em>. I&#8217;ve never really noticed my sandwiches being arranged in a artistic fashion before, maybe it would brighten my day if they were. I feel sorry for the poor art school graduate who ends up filling baguettes for a living.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have examples of jobs with somewhat over enthusiastic job titles?</p>

          <p>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my &#8220;business&#8221; cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing &#8220;beta&#8221; on hand hand-made ones or something&#8230;</p>

          <p>Yes, yes I know I already posted about the <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/08/08/fowa-roadtrip-bristol/">FOWA Roadtrip in Bristol</a>, but I live in Cardiff and have friends and <a href="http://www.gr0w.com">colleagues in Bristol too</a>. I promise I didn&#8217;t just head there for free drinks once again. This time the <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems team</a> had pulled together some funky little <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/">FOWA Roadtrip</a> badges that they handed out on the door, rather than the stickers at Bristol. I&#8217;d previously learned that Ryan&#8217;s wife, Gillian had taken a MSc in Cardiff and it seems the same is true of <a href="http://carsonsystems.com/about.html">Lisa Price</a> too. I had a really interesting conversation with Lisa about how Future Publishing (whom she previously worked for) produced one of my favourite mags (PCFormat) back in my adolescence. (I actually still own all the magazines I bought for like 3 years and harbour plans to ship them back to Future in Bath, along with all the CDs).</p>
<p>Anyway, it was grand that those who were involved in the web app scene in Cardiff finally made it to an event together, and our newly formed <a href="http://cardiffgeeks.net">Cardiff Geeks</a> group is already scheming to stage another meet up for geeky people. (It&#8217;s a good label, it&#8217;s a nerd you don&#8217;t want to be).</p>
