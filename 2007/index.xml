      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&amp;#8217;ll be rewarded. It&amp;#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the small hosting company that I&amp;#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&amp;#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &amp;#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.</description>

      <description>Today on the return from uni I passed the new Subway that is opening up soon near Queen Street train station. On one of their job adverts, they were advertising for team leaders and sandwich artists. I&amp;#8217;ve never really noticed my sandwiches being arranged in a artistic fashion before, maybe it would brighten my day if they were. I feel sorry for the poor art school graduate who ends up filling baguettes for a living.</description>

      <title>FOWA Roadtrip Cardiff</title>

      <description>Yes, yes I know I already posted about the FOWA Roadtrip in Bristol, but I live in Cardiff and have friends and colleagues in Bristol too. I promise I didn&amp;#8217;t just head there for free drinks once again. This time the Carson Systems team had pulled together some funky little FOWA Roadtrip badges that they handed out on the door, rather than the stickers at Bristol. I&amp;#8217;d previously learned that Ryan&amp;#8217;s wife, Gillian had taken a MSc in Cardiff and it seems the same is true of Lisa Price too.</description>

      <description>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my &amp;#8220;business&amp;#8221; cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing &amp;#8220;beta&amp;#8221; on hand hand-made ones or something&amp;#8230;</description>

      <description>Since moving to Taffs Well, just outside of Cardiff, Viv and I have enjoyed fantastic views of the Garth. This mountain is the centre for the original true story of &amp;#8220;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down A Mountain&amp;#8221;, a book/film which I managed to catch on TV this week. Basically, it goes like this, the villagers of Taffs Well work together to try to prevent an English cartographer from leaving the village and classifying the Garth as a hill.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve long wondered why there doesn&amp;#8217;t seem to be much happening in terms of community of the web professionals in wales. There is a vibrant collection of people sporting different skill sets in the area, yet as I can see not a lot of chat amongst everyone in between different groups. On a whim, I decided to create a facebook group &amp;#8220;Cardiff Web Geeks&amp;#8221; to try and get people to come out of their shells and actually participate in a bit of discussion about tech topics in wales.</description>

      <description>Wow, Apple have released a new touch version of the iPod (think the iPhone with no phone) as well as updating the classic iPod (160Gb!) and new nano versions. This actually means I&amp;#8217;d be able to have an iPod which fits my entire music collection upon it with room to spare. I&amp;#8217;ve waited a long time for that. The iPod touch also allows wireless browsing and download of new music via iTunes.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve heard a couple of rumours this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&amp;#8217;s some discussion over on facereviews.com that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &amp;#8220;social networks&amp;#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for?</description>

      <description>The other evening I managed to stretch my back awkwardly and I&amp;#8217;ve been feeling the repercussions of it ever since. It&amp;#8217;s extremely painful to move my head, arm or neck and I&amp;#8217;m getting really frustrated by not being able to sit at the computer without being uncomfortable. Wednesday night I was flat out in bed not able to move an inch, and little more of an improvement last night. It&amp;#8217;s making me really tired and irritable.</description>

      <description>Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of Ryan Carsons Future of Web Applications Roadtrip. It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &amp;#8220;large fire&amp;#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down.</description>

      <description>Now that the big day has passed, I thought I&amp;#8217;d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is Go Ape.</description>

      <description>Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&amp;#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&amp;#8217;s never had a home before and we&amp;#8217;ve never owned it.</description>

      <description>The wonderful hackers of, er Britain. When I say we, I actually mean me because my wife to be has to head back to Abergavenny before me. Which means that actually I&amp;#8217;ll be the only one able to make use of my free invite to see the rumble strips. Oh well.I&amp;#8217;m actually a bit nervy about heading over &amp;#8211; I have done an extreme lack of preparation in terms of programming and I&amp;#8217;m going to be sleeping in a room full of nerds and pcs, or possibly not.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve just returned from my stint in the South East after being invited to attend Googles London Developer day on thursday and remaining there to hang out in Haddenham for the weekend. Theres a ton of photo&amp;#8217;s over on a picasa web album which has been built up from peoples pics. I even got interviewed regarding using the google web toolkit, but my experience was not exactly extended so I don&amp;#8217;t know if it would get used at all.</description>

I&amp;#8217;d completely forgotten but just got an invite asking me if I wanted to come along. Crazy! First yahoo, now google!

I signed up half expecting to be told to &amp;#8220;go jump&amp;#8221; and I&amp;#8217;d contacted the administrators of the list due to hearing nothing about it and some confusing responses at first &amp;#8211; but I just got my proper invite. Woo! &amp;#8211; Impressive as I didn&amp;#8217;t put much of an explanation of my work on there. I guess it was my sob story about my ongoing PhD.</description>

      <description>Mashable is reporting that a Microsoft-Yahoo merger may be on the cards, which is a fairly bizarre prospect.
The price? $50 Billion, is Yahoo only worth 30 odd YouTubes? I for one think not.</description>

      <description>This afternoon I was quite chuffed to discover that I&amp;#8217;d been selected for a Joost beta invite. Joost is, in a nutshell, TV for the web . Kind of the opposite to that Current TV channel on Virgin Media. I&amp;#8217;ve been playing with it this evening, mainly perusing the XL-Recordings and gaming channels.It all seems very good &amp;#8211; a good seelction of channels (for me) straight off, with the ability to search Joost&amp;#8217;s catalog of channels and add more to your collection.</description>

      <description>Threadless has launched threadlesskids.com &amp;#8211; like threadless, but for kids. I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis recent announcement. Anyway, it looks wicked &amp;#8211; its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</description>

      <description>Currently Viv and I are planning our wedding for later in the year, which aside from being the most exciting thing ever, is really, really stressful. Apparently though, there are wed designers about, though I never realised.</description>

      <description>If anyone else like me is considering working in the uk &amp;#8220;web 2.0&amp;#8243; market, and finds the posts on common job boards clogged up with all the jobs from america, the small job board I have created and posted online might be a help. You&amp;#8217;ll find it over at: http://webtyrant.com/jobs. It aggregates some common job boards together like 37Signals and ThinkVitamin, but removes anything but those located in the UK.</description>

      <description>pMachine has changed its name to Ellislab, and are sporting a shiny new website for all to see. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don&amp;#8217;t fall under the same banner now. I&amp;#8217;m glad to see that the CodeIgniter website has got a facelift. 31three did the hard graft on the design and they all look awesome.</description>

      <title>OpenID - The end of multiple passwords?</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/08/openid---the-end-of-multiple-passwords/</link>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing some really good stuff about openID recently. For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It&amp;#8217;s recently risen to light with the adoption by WordPress.com as a provider and digg as an adopter.Complaints against wordpress.com&amp;#8217;s non-allowance of logins with openID&amp;#8217;s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded.</description>

If you want some ideas of what you can get me (I obviously expect a gift), why not check my gift list here and here, to save the embarrasment of some really awful gift.</description>

      <description>Tonight, Cineworld gave us tickets free to any film of our choice when we were meant to be seeing a preview, due to a cock up at their end. I already knew what it would be without looking at what was out, Hot Fuzz.
I&amp;#8217;ve loved Simon Pegg ever since the days of Big Train, when humour was just so completely random it had to be funny. Shaun of the Dead had some great random moments in it, but I left it feeling that it wasn&amp;#8217;t the best I&amp;#8217;d come to expect.</description>

      <description>Thought I&amp;#8217;d just point out that apple uk are touting the new ipod shuffle today. Basically they have launched a bunch of extra colours, with no change to size or capacity, but they do look rather pretty.   .</description>

      <description>I came across hotdealsuk prior to christmas and I think its an absolute must for any techie thats currently residing in the uk. Basically, a sophisticated messageboard, bargains of interest to the community are highlighted and then voted upon. Those more highly voted make it through to the front page.
I absolutely love it and so far have managed to purchase 1 xbox (with 4 games) @ £50 and a 400Gb harddrive @ £83.</description>

      <description>If anyone would like to contribute to allow me to attend the Future of Web Apps or the Future of Web Design conferences over the next few months, I&amp;#8217;d put together some independent reviews of the events on this site. As the funds of a lowly research student are not all that much cop, you can donate some funds using the donation page.At the moment, registration for Web Apps is £195 + VAT (£595 + VAT including workshops), and Web Design is £59 +VAT.</description>

      <description>Richmond road in Cardiff today is pretty much like a river all the way down today, due to all the horrid weather hitting it, resulting in the following set of footprints (post cycling to work) around my office.</description>

      <description>I had a some great times away on holidays recently. The first was at New Year in Rhayader with the usual suspects getting absolutely soaked and vowing never to let anyone else plan a walk ever again. It was good to get outside away from these pesky machines.
  
As if that wasn&amp;#8217;t enough, I went away to France to the slightly more exciting Alps for a skiing holiday for a week too.</description>
