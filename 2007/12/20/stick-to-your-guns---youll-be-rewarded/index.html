    <p>I&#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&#8217;ll be rewarded. It&#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the <a href="http://www.xen10.com">small hosting company</a> that I&#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.</p>

<p>Today, one of my favourite breaks record labels (Marine Parade) were offering a compo to win a cd by responding to them over myspace. (Ok, maybe a somewhat less grandiose scenario than this post may have made out, but still!) I&#8217;ve long refused to sign up to myspace out of principles (it looks bloody awful, mainly) so I sent them a message to point it out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to respond to get the cd via myspace, I feel I shouldn&#8217;t have to be forced to use that poor excuse for an interweb page.</p>

<p>Anyway, here is my address just in case you feel like sending me Adam Freelands &#8211; Tectonics.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To my joy, they didn&#8217;t care!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fair enough, you get one!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever won a competition due to principles. Maybe I should start bending the rules of other competitions and still try to win prizes?</p>
