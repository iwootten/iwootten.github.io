      <description>Wow! A long time ago I signed up for google&amp;#8217;s developer day, to be on their waiting list. I&amp;#8217;d completely forgotten but just got an invite asking me if I wanted to come along. Crazy! First yahoo, now google! I&amp;#8217;m very, very excited.Obviously I am not more excited about either of these days than my wedding day&amp;#8230; </description>

      <description>I just heard I&amp;#8217;ve got invited to Hackday! That&amp;#8217;s totally awesome, I&amp;#8217;m really excited! I signed up half expecting to be told to &amp;#8220;go jump&amp;#8221; and I&amp;#8217;d contacted the administrators of the list due to hearing nothing about it and some confusing responses at first &amp;#8211; but I just got my proper invite. Woo! &amp;#8211; Impressive as I didn&amp;#8217;t put much of an explanation of my work on there. I guess it was my sob story about my ongoing PhD.</description>

      <description>Mashable is reporting that a Microsoft-Yahoo merger may be on the cards, which is a fairly bizarre prospect.
The price? $50 Billion, is Yahoo only worth 30 odd YouTubes? I for one think not.</description>
