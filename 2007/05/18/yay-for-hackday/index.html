    <p>I just heard I’ve got invited to <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">Hackday</a>! That’s totally awesome, I’m really excited! I signed up half expecting to be told to “go jump” and I’d contacted the administrators of the list due to hearing nothing about it and some confusing responses at first – but I just got my proper invite. Woo! – Impressive as I didn’t put much of an explanation of my work on there. I guess it was my sob story about my ongoing PhD.Props go to <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">Tom Coates</a> whose blog first pointed it out for me. Oh, and the fact he maybe has something to do with organising the event!Interestingly, this is a week before my stag do and a week after my moving house – which means I probably won’t be getting much sleep in June.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
