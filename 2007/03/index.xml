I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis recent announcement. Anyway, it looks wicked – its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</description></item><item><title>Wed Designer - I wish I had one!'</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/19/wed-designer-i-wish-i-had-one/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/19/wed-designer-i-wish-i-had-one/</guid><description>Currently Viv and I are planning our wedding for later in the year, which aside from being the most exciting thing ever, is really, really stressful.

You’ll find it over at: http://webtyrant.com/jobs. It aggregates some common job boards together like 37Signals and ThinkVitamin, but removes anything but those located in the UK.</description></item><item><title>pMachine changes its name</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/09/pmachine-changes-its-name/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/09/pmachine-changes-its-name/</guid><description>pMachine has changed its name to Ellislab, and are sporting a shiny new website for all to see. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don’t fall under the same banner now.

For those who don’t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It’s recently risen to light with the adoption by WordPress.com as a provider and digg as an adopter.Complaints against wordpress.com’s non-allowance of logins with openID’s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded.</description></item><item><title>It's my birthday soon</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/07/its-my-birthday-soon/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/07/its-my-birthday-soon/</guid><description>Did you not know?
