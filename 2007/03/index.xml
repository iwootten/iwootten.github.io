      <description>[via Vecosys]I&amp;#8217;ve just read on vecosys&amp;#8217; blog that Stormhoek has just posted Threshers Voucher Number 2. This will most certainly come in handy for all that wine we need to get for the wedding&amp;#8230;.Go grab it over here.</description>

      <description>Threadless has launched threadlesskids.com &amp;#8211; like threadless, but for kids. I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis recent announcement. Anyway, it looks wicked &amp;#8211; its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</description>

      <description>Currently Viv and I are planning our wedding for later in the year, which aside from being the most exciting thing ever, is really, really stressful. Apparently though, there are wed designers about, though I never realised.</description>

      <title>UK Jobs in Web 2.0</title>

      <description>If anyone else like me is considering working in the uk &amp;#8220;web 2.0&amp;#8243; market, and finds the posts on common job boards clogged up with all the jobs from america, the small job board I have created and posted online might be a help. You&amp;#8217;ll find it over at: http://webtyrant.com/jobs. It aggregates some common job boards together like 37Signals and ThinkVitamin, but removes anything but those located in the UK.</description>

      <title>pMachine changes its name</title>
      <link>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/09/pmachine-changes-its-name/</link>

      <guid>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/09/pmachine-changes-its-name/</guid>
      <description>pMachine has changed its name to Ellislab, and are sporting a shiny new website for all to see. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don&amp;#8217;t fall under the same banner now. I&amp;#8217;m glad to see that the CodeIgniter website has got a facelift. 31three did the hard graft on the design and they all look awesome.</description>

      <title>OpenID - The end of multiple passwords?</title>
      <link>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/03/08/openid---the-end-of-multiple-passwords/</link>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been hearing some really good stuff about openID recently. For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It&amp;#8217;s recently risen to light with the adoption by WordPress.com as a provider and digg as an adopter.Complaints against wordpress.com&amp;#8217;s non-allowance of logins with openID&amp;#8217;s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded.</description>

If you want some ideas of what you can get me (I obviously expect a gift), why not check my gift list here and here, to save the embarrasment of some really awful gift.</description>
