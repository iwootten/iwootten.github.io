This mountain is the centre for the original true story of “The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down A Mountain”, a book/film which I managed to catch on TV this week. Basically, it goes like this, the villagers of Taffs Well work together to try to prevent an English cartographer from leaving the village and classifying the Garth as a hill. They gradually take soil to the top of the (then) hill and eventually get it classed as a mountain by the cartographer. Carrying all that soil is no easy feat – it does require roping in all the villagers into getting it up the hill. It was quite amusing to be sitting in our living room watching a film about the mountain which could be seen through the window right next to our television. Anyway I’m really enjoying it out here – its such a sight to wake up every morning and see the Garth covered in cloud at its peak. I hope Viv and I get the chance and enough enthusiasm to walk it together soon. <a href=http://blog.stuartherbert.com/>Stuart Herbert</a> has some <a href=http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartherbert/tags/thegarth/>great pics of the Garth on flickr</a>.</p><p></p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/09/07/cardiff-geeks/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
