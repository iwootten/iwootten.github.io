      <description>Now that the big day has passed, I thought I&amp;#8217;d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is Go Ape.</description>

      <description>Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&amp;#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&amp;#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&amp;#8217;s never had a home before and we&amp;#8217;ve never owned it.</description>
