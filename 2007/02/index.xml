      <description>Tonight, Cineworld gave us tickets free to any film of our choice when we were meant to be seeing a preview, due to a cock up at their end. I already knew what it would be without looking at what was out, Hot Fuzz.
I&amp;#8217;ve loved Simon Pegg ever since the days of Big Train, when humour was just so completely random it had to be funny. Shaun of the Dead had some great random moments in it, but I left it feeling that it wasn&amp;#8217;t the best I&amp;#8217;d come to expect.</description>

      <description>Thought I&amp;#8217;d just point out that apple uk are touting the new ipod shuffle today. Basically they have launched a bunch of extra colours, with no change to size or capacity, but they do look rather pretty.   .</description>
