          <p>I&#8217;ve heard a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/would_you_share_your_search_history.php">couple</a> of <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-facebook-app.html">rumours</a> this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&#8217;s some discussion over on <a href="http://facereviews.com/2007/08/28/google-facebook-application-a-hoax/">facereviews.com</a> that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &#8220;social networks&#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for? Probably not at all &#8211; I don&#8217;t want everyone to be clued in to all those random tee sites I&#8217;m able to find. Probably nobody would really be interested, so whats the point anyway?</p>

<p>It also brings to mind an idea that I&#8217;ve been toying with for sharing how links between pages are made, where details of hyperlink clicks are captured to some repository somewhere. This would make it it possible for users to have a series of heatmaps upon any page to display details of common links that other users choose to follow from one page to another, and common routes accross the net to particular pages. Similar issues for whether or not takeup would occur, or the information is indeed useful to everyone exist also.</p>

          <p>The other evening I managed to stretch my back awkwardly and I&#8217;ve been feeling the repercussions of it ever since. It&#8217;s extremely painful to move my head, arm or neck and I&#8217;m getting really frustrated by not being able to sit at the computer without being uncomfortable. Wednesday night I was flat out in bed not able to move an inch, and little more of an improvement last night. It&#8217;s making me really tired and irritable. Grr!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Aug 2007</div>

          <p>Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of <a href="http://carsonified.com">Ryan Carsons</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Applications</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/raodtrip">Roadtrip</a>. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down. Luckily, at about 6.30pm the line opened up again and I made it over to Bristol. I&#8217;d met up with Evan Rudowski and Jo(?) of <a href="http://www.subhub.com">SubHub</a> prior at Cardiff station and therefore headed over with them.</p>
<p>It was a good evening, with me able to catch up with <a href="http://jontangerine.com">Jon</a> and <a href="http://dotjay.co.uk">Jon</a> of the <a href="http://gr0w.com">Grow Collective</a> (with whom I shall hopefully be working with very soon, but more on that later). I don&#8217;t think I ever used the free drink I was entitled too with my lovely check sticker Ryan graced me with. A similar event is happening in Cardiff on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip">10th September over in the bay</a>, if you&#8217;re a web type in wales you&#8217;d probably do well to check it out.</p>
<p>Update: there&#8217;s more info on the event on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/thanks-bristol/">Future of Web Apps blog</a>. I even made it into a couple of photos, albeit adorning a rucksack. The fire in Newport <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6936270.stm">completely destroyed a row of houses</a>. I guess I didn&#8217;t have it that bad&#8230;</p>
