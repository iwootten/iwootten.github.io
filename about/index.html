    <p>Hi, I’m Ian.</p>
<p>I’m a software engineer living in Cardiff in the UK. I run a small software development company, <a href="http://niftydigits.com">Nifty Digits Ltd</a> which specialises in Python.</p>
<p>Here I publish my thoughts on anything that takes my fancy - and I have done so for the last 18 years! A <em>lot</em> has changed in that time for me.</p>
<p>I hold a PhD in Computer Science from Cardiff University. Probably the most valuable skills I learnt whilst writing it were about myself, rather than anything in my final thesis.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to heard from you if you found anything useful or want to discuss further. The quickest way to get in touch would be via <a href="https://twitter.com/iwootten">twitter</a> or alternatively any of the other services I use in the sidebar which I check in on less frequently.</p>
