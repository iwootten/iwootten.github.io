		   <p><a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a> is reporting that a <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/05/04/microsoft-yahoo/">Microsoft-Yahoo merger may be on the cards</a>, which is a fairly bizarre prospect.</p>

<p>The price? $50 Billion, is Yahoo only worth 30 odd YouTubes? I for one think not.</p>

		   <p>I don’t really understand microsoft, over the last few days, their live network has been experiencing problems every time I’ve tried to logon to access my email. Who knows what my 8 emails contain which are hidden within live mail, I certainly don’t. You would think that more people would be in uproar about this – I mean what if these were payment requests, final demands or quick response business proposals? I could be loosing out on some serious money here.</p>

<p>Apparently, even they are unsure of the problem – it could be that “This site may be experiencing a problem” or “The site may not be a member of the Windows Live Network”. These seem quite vague, I mean obviously the sites experiencing a problem as everything would be fine and dandy if not and I’m pretty sure that Live mail is a member of their Live network too. Why don’t you try telling me something that I don’t already know?</p>
