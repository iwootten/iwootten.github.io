      <div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2013</div>

          <p>10 years ago today, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That&#8217;s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that&#8217;s quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 &#8220;weblog tool&#8221;</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>
<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed &#8211; I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently &#8211; which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I&#8217;m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I&#8217;m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it&#8217;s the moments I don&#8217;t share that are most important to me.</p>
<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>

          <p>Last week, tickets went on sale for dConstruct 2011 and sold out within an impressive 7 hours. Having attended in 2010 and 2008 and judging it to be filled with the highest calibre web celebs from across the globe, I coughed up the entrance fee as part of the excited gold-rush. The cost of £150 includes access to the pre and after parties and the conference itself.</p>
<p>These type of events are stuffed to the brim with amazing, intelligent web professionals, many of whom I would consider to be colleagues. I’ve followed their progress, listened to them speak, bought their publications and hacked on code with them at many other previous events.</p>
<p>It’s often quoted within tech circles that the best parts of these events are not the talks themselves, but the networking parties that surround them. I really struggle in these environments, nervously trying to find a crowd I feel comfortable chatting with, introducing myself and trying to strike up some cutting edge debate on the topics of the day. I’m a developer who usually lurks behind a computer screen for 8 hours a day, so why wouldn’t I find it awkward? It feels like uncharted territory every time I find myself there. Although meeting some great, interesting people, I have ultimately never forged any new lasting relations in this way, where the interaction is somewhat forced and artificial. Maybe it’s just me, but given the com mon nature of everyones work, you’d think it might be easier. As a friend once observed &#8211; it’s like everyone turns up to sell their product, but there are no buyers.</p>
<p>It’s also great to be able to chat within the inner circle of the celebrities who attend. You’ve heard from them all year round and now have a brief opportunity to chat. I guess really I’d love to bounce questions and thoughts off of these guys all evening, but often I get the feeling I’m being evaluated against the rest of the attendees in the room in terms of worthiness. Until you’re edging<br>into such circles yourself, I’m not entirely sure what they would get from these conversations either.</p>
<p>In fact, what I have found is that my most fruitful and long lasting relations have been founded at events when in a participatory nature. Most of these have been Hack Days (where you’re invited to quickly hack together software as an exemplar of new apis from a number of vendors) and some of them have been at Bar Camps (where all attendees have to speak on a subject close to their heart). I feel closer to these people than I could ever do with someone I spoke with briefly in a noisy bar. I’ll also remember faces and names of people even if I never had the chance to interact with them.</p>
<p>This year, a new variety of geek meet has arisen, which flip these more traditional events on their heads and instead focus on providing environments that focus on “the best bits”. They allow everyone to participate on level pegging rather than follow a traditional conference structure. Earlier this month there was <a href=“http://geekkart.in”>Geek Karting</a>, <a href=“http://insitestour.com”>The Insites Tour</a> is kicking off next week and later this year there’s <a href=“http://preparetoactivate.com”>Activate</a>. I really like the idea of these as a way of sparking interesting relationships and I’m hopefully going to head to Insites next week to see what Elliot and Keir have been able to cook up. I’d hope to see more of these unusual types of event and ultimately participate in more of them.</p>
<p>I still feel that conferences have their place, otherwise I wouldn’t have coughed up the fee for dConstruct. I enjoy hearing what these illustrious speakers have to say. That part of the event is still important for sparking debate and learning from for months and years afterward. However, I just don’t find surrounding parties as valuable to me as I first would have thought.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 Feb 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been pondering this morning how the use of the internet has (or may have) changed my life. As a child/teen during the web&#8217;s infancy, I was blissfully unaware that so many lifes/careers/relationships would be enabled or changed as a result of the interactions it might facilitate. I hadn&#8217;t even heard of google prior to arriving at university and two years prior to that had never had internet access anywhere locally.<br>I am sure my behaviour today would be pretty different if the web wasn&#8217;t around due to the massive impact its had in my world view. It seems a far smaller place and more tightly coupled. I feel free to drop messages to strangers and write blog posts into the ether. I won a T4 competition in my early uni years which landed me a car and £4k richer, which I wouldn&#8217;t have entered if I&#8217;d had to phone &#8211; so I&#8217;d definitely be poorer. There are however, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6187554.stm">examples</a> where the use of the web has had a detrimental effect on particular individual lives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge one to think about. Would my life be better as a result of the web having not been so widely adopted in the way it has? Would yours?</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 May 2008</div>

          <p>Just a quick note to remind people that this coming week is the third Cardiff meetup for web types in wales. It&#8217;s in 10 Feet Tall on Church St on Wednesday 4th June from 6.30pm. Featured speakers include <a href="http://www.thelondonbiker.com/">Matthew Cashmore</a> (Development Producer for BBC Future Media &#038; Technology, Research and Innovation) and <a href="http://timholmes.blogspot.com/">Tim Holmes</a> (Course co-ordinator for the Postgraduate Diploma in Magazine Journalism and the MA International Journalism: Magazine Pathway at Cardiff University&#8217;s School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies). It sounds like its going to be two really interesting talks with Matt discussing BBC Backstage and Mashed, whilst Tim will be chatting about journalism for the web. If thats not enough, there is even bands that you would normally have to pay for on afterwards. </p>
