      <div class="author_meta">27 Oct 2013</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve purchased a couple of .is straight from the Icelandic Domain Registry (ISNIC) in the past year with a view to using them with my own vps. The process of setting up nameservers isn&#8217;t great, given their somewhat confusing management interface. That&#8217;s summed up in a recent tweet below.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Looks like I just spent 39 euros on a domain I canâ€™t use. Fucksticks.</p>&mdash; Craig Lockwood (@craiginwales) <a href="https://twitter.com/craiginwales/statuses/394167434196058112">October 26, 2013</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Given the potential savings compared to a &#8216;normal&#8217; registrar, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll want to make use of ISNIC themselves &#8211; who are much like an Icelandic version of Nominet.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the process I went through to configure my domain to make use of the nameservers provided by my (non-icelandic) host. The information provided <a href="http://web.peterhartree.co.uk/2012/how-to-register-an-icelandic-is-domain-name/">here</a> is a little misleading as it&#8217;s not necessary to use a &#8220;pre-approved&#8221; registrar according to the rules outlined <a href="https://www.isnic.is/en/host/req">here</a>. To be clear, there&#8217;s no need to use something like x.is, and you can point ISNIC directly to your hosts nameservers.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone through the process of checking your domain is available and registering it, you&#8217;ll need to ensure your hosting provider has appropriate dns entries for your domain. If you&#8217;re using, cPanel or something that basically means adding it there. If you&#8217;re managing your own dns entries, add the appropriate entries within your manager.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the key bit. Now wait&#8230;. Seriously, for about 6 hours or so do something else. It will take some time for these dns changes to propagate and ISNIC to accept them. Basically these details need to be bounced up through the hierarchy of dns servers to the root dns servers that will respond to a request for your new domain, which takes time. In the olden days, I remember waiting days for this to happen.</p>
<p>Following that wait, head to the &#8220;redelegate&#8221; option within your new &#8220;My Page&#8221; area at ISNIC. Choose the &#8220;Not Registered&#8221; when asked for your ISP.</p>
<p>Go ahead and enter the nameservers you want to use. If the dns changes haven&#8217;t yet propagated, you&#8217;ll probably get the error &#8220;The nameserver &#8216;ns1.whatever.com&#8217; has not been registered&#8221;, as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-23.57.26.png"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-23.57.26.png" alt="Misleading Error" width="676" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912" /></a></p>
<p>This is a pretty misleading error, given what it actually means is &#8220;your domain doesn&#8217;t seem to be registered yet on those nameservers&#8221;. So wait a bit more for propagation to occur&#8230;</p>
<p>Be aware of the <a href="https://www.isnic.is/en/host/req">rules</a> for ISNIC nameservers and check your host complies with them, otherwise you may find you encounter other errors. When the changes are picked up, you should finally be able to add the entries without getting an array of red boxes, much like below.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">20 Dec 2007</div>

          <p>I&#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&#8217;ll be rewarded. It&#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the <a href="http://www.xen10.com">small hosting company</a> that I&#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.</p>
<p>Today, one of my favourite breaks record labels (Marine Parade) were offering a compo to win a cd by responding to them over myspace. (Ok, maybe a somewhat less grandiose scenario than this post may have made out, but still!) I&#8217;ve long refused to sign up to myspace out of principles (it looks bloody awful, mainly) so I sent them a message to point it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to respond to get the cd via myspace, I feel I shouldn&#8217;t have to be forced to use that poor excuse for an interweb page.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is my address just in case you feel like sending me Adam Freelands &#8211; Tectonics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my joy, they didn&#8217;t care!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fair enough, you get one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever won a competition due to principles. Maybe I should start bending the rules of other competitions and still try to win prizes?</p>
