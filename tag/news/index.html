	<p>Threadless has launched <a href="http://threadlesskids.com">threadlesskids.com</a> – like threadless, but for kids. I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis <a href="http://jakeandshondi.com/index/35/The_new_addition">recent announcement</a>. Anyway, it looks wicked – its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</p>

<div class="author_meta">21 Dec 2006</div>
	<p>Apparently, according to the free English dictionary there is a couple of definitions other than the traditional UK understanding of the word pantomime. For those international readers who don’t know, a pantomime is a pretty awful example of B-List celebrities acting ability in the UK in which involves them dressing up in bad costumes and acting out a fairy tale or story. In Cardiff, the big panto is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk – where Jack is played by <a href="http://www.newtheatrecardiff.co.uk/English/whatson_detail.asp?ID=187">John Barrowman</a> (or Captain Jack from Torchwood and Dr Who). The other definition is: ‘The telling of a story without words, by means of bodily movements, gestures, and facial expressions.’.Sam Sethi has been in the <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/12/14/sam-sethi-is-sacked-from-techcrunch-uk/">news</a> <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/12/14/sam-sethi-has-nowhere-to-blog/">recently</a> with articles reporting on his departure from TechcrunchUK. <a href="http://samsethi.glaxstar.com/?p=30">Sam has recently called</a> Mike Arrington’s <a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=327">interpretation of events</a> a bit of a pantomime, with a lot of “oh no it isn’t”, “oh yes it is” type comments going on. The whole scenario has rolled on for a while now and definitely does not conform to the second interpretation of a pantomime. My only wish was that the original intention for the Techcrunch sites, i.e to report on web start-ups, be it in Europe or elsewhere remained the primary concern for them, and I didn’t have to be subjected to the arguments that editors of such blogs may have with one another. Then again, I may be perpetuating the whole ordeal by writing this post….</p>

	<p>Digg.com is sporting the ability to be able to now rate online video and podcasts. Postcast searching is in limited beta for registered users only.I just spent a while perusing some items of interest, and found a great segment of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8169033819829939284&#038;hl=en">play</a>! over on google. This just builds on the fact that Mario has the most awesome music ever.The searching of podcasts is dangerously close to an idea I’ve currently working on myself for a while now. Maybe I should get on with it.</p>

	<p><a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch UK</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com">Techcrunch’s</a> european sister site has recently had a lot of activiity from <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/12/11/le-web3-the-good-bad-and-ugly/">some notes</a> which the editor at the time, Sam Sethi made about the recent <a href="http://leweb3.com">leweb3</a> event.This invited some comments from Six Apart’s Loic Le Meur in which he called Sam “an asshole”. Sam subsequently posted another blog about the fact that TechcrunchUK would be setting up its own events and workshops in the forthcoming year. It seems this displeased techcrunch’s Mike Arrington enough to give Sam the boot. The TechcrunchUK site has since been put on hold.I enjoyed TechcrunchUK’s insight into the UK world of web 2.0, I sorely hope this does not signal its end.</p>

<div class="author_meta">01 Dec 2006</div>
	<p><a href="http://www.threadless.com/?streetteam=scrumpyjack"><img src="http://www.threadless.com/scrap/myspace/lovethreadless.gif" border="0" /></a>Last night I perused a number of articles describing the success of my favourite t-shirt store <a href="http://threadless.com">threadless</a>, the first of which – over at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/68-7-reasons-why-threadless-rules">37Signals</a> reviews in a positive light and the <a href="http://www.hiphipuk.co.uk/2006/11/07/7-reasons-why-threadless-dont-rule-as-much-as-they-used-too/">second in a more negative one</a>.<a href="http://threadless.com">Threadless</a> is a t-shirt company with a difference, it’s a 24-7 competition allow you to become the designer. Designs are chosen by the team, and are able to be rated by the community that operates around the website.For anyone who knows me, they’ll know I love threadless tees – I believe I’m on my 4th one this week, and I have more in the post. I even got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/256308445/">engaged in one of their t-shirts</a>, although it was possibly the most highly innappropriate one to do it in.<center>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imw/256308445/" title="Engaged"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/79/256308445_df791e697c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CIMG7458.JPG" /></a>
</center>I </p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/255906494/">visited</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/255906648/">them</a> when as I was about in Chicago, though I think they probably thought I was a bit of an English loon. I find their designs original and amusing but it seems that those who kicked off the site are kicking back with some negative comments on what the sites community now represents. It shook me a bit that not everyone is as overly enthusiastic with them as I.<center>

</center>+’s:(from 37Signals) </p>

<p><strong>They’re playful</strong> – I have to say that this is one of the aspects I find most appealing, just the sheer comedy value to be found in not only their shirt designs, but the website (including many videos of daily threadless life), their emails, their attitude to the popularity. It’s great, it makes people feel good.<strong>It’s driven by community</strong> – This is what makes any web app successful but it seems threadless have been at it from day one and done a really good job at integrating it into their site. 37Signals points out the fact that participation is equal (though is visually far larger on their design), to the main consumer reason for visiting the site. When I was about to head out to Chicago, I contacted threadless as a customer to query the length of time it was taking to get an order out to me, and cheekily asked if they had any recommendations for places to visit while I was out there. Brianne, their customer service lass, replied with a huge description of what there was to do in the area, along with her personal favourites – its that kind of dedication to their community which builds them loyal customers.-’s:<strong>Bad Canvas, Second Rate Knock Offs</strong> – I don’t think their t-shirts are bad quality! Blimey, they’re only $10 half the time! Seriously, the printing quality claims and ‘feel’ of the shirts used are all a bit unfounded I think and more likely the result of teens who don’t know how to execute proper household management. The second aspect there however is going to be tackled when they soon start using their <a href="http://www.threadless.com/news/88235/EXCITING_NEWS_ABOUT_THE_TEES_WE_PRINT_ON">own specially designed material</a>. I read one example of a chap complaining of bad quality, who then went on to say he’d purchased a bunch more – surely they can’t be all that bad to warrant further purchases? As for second rate knock offs, I can’t say that I know the design community inside out, but I know I’ve never seen any of the designs anywhere else, and thats half the reason I love them.<strong>It’s myspace with t-shirts</strong> – Ah, yes, I feel your pain. Although I love what I can get out of threadless with a passion (i.e tees), I certainly despise myspace with a huge amount of disgust. I’ve previously blogged about the fact that <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/11/13/do-web-users-want-web-standards/">myspace</a> needs to sort out its web standards, I also have a certain distaste for the types of people who hang out in such virtual communities, with nothing better to do. If threadless is the t-shirt equivalent of myspace, they’ve got two aspects right (t-shirts, web standards), but then nothing can alter the types of people that hang out there, at least not this instant. I think these types are always going to be of a certain nature. I’m oblivious to these users, as I’m not actively contributing in this manner, I’m just the consumer, so what does that really matter to me? Of course it would be embarrasing to meet said teens in my university class wearing the same shirts, but I’m in the uk and I haven’t seen many people with threadless this side of the country. In fact, I’ve only ever seen them in Chicago (go figure!), and Singapore.Anyway, I still assert that I love threadless, despite other opinions and people will still be getting shirts as presents over christmas. I may however, try to attempt getting tees from other equally good shirt sites, for fear of wearing clothing resembling my students.For those of who appreciate them also, check out this image of how one of their employees, charlie will soon be working daily:<center>

</center>That’s just pure quality.</p>
