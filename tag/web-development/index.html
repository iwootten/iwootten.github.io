	<h1><a href="/2013/04/03/the-problem-with-full-stack-js-applications">The Problem with Full Stack JS Applications</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 Apr 2013</div>
	<p>Whilst node.js heralded an era of being able to use a single language for both server and client side development, nobody mentioned the confusion such an approach could cause. It’s inevitable that there’s going to be similarities in code that constructs data on the server and that which presents it on the client. The fact that the two are written in the same language and the structure of them is so tightly coupled can make it easy to lose track of where you are and what you’re doing when knee deep in code.</p>

<p>Having primarily been using a full js stack (express on the server, backbone on the client) for side projects over the last year or so, I’ve certainly found myself tied up in this kind of knot. For example, if I’m looking at event.js, which represents an event on a calendar it could be the server event representation, used as an accessor for a db or a client side backbone model presenting the events attributes as part of a view. Usually (if you’re using a sensible class naming scheme) it is enough to know the file (.php or .js) within which you’re working and if that’s not enough, then the language syntax usually is a dead giveaway for where you are in your codebase. But this isn’t the case when working in one language. My guess is you’re going to have to take a second glance in order to figure out where you are, which isn’t a big issue, but is frustrating.</p>

<p>Currently my apps typically are structured like this:</p>

<p>server.js (Main node/express file)<br />
-lib (Classes for DB Calls)<br />
-node_modules (Node requires)<br />
-public (Client backbone app)<br />
    -css<br />
    -images<br />
    -js<br />
        -lib (Backbone and other dependencies)<br />
        -collections<br />
        -models<br />
        -templates<br />
        -views<br />
-routes (Contains the main express routes)</p>

<p>But I actually think the following is a better approach:</p>

<p>-server<br />
    server.js<br />
    -lib<br />
    -node_modules<br />
    -routes<br />
-client (Renamed from public)<br />
    -css<br />
    -images<br />
    -js<br />
        -lib<br />
        -collections<br />
        -models<br />
        -templates<br />
        -views</p>

<p>At least with the second approach, it is easier to have a clear idea of where to find classes on first opening them. Unfortunately, this doesn’t however solve my problem of moving between server side and client logic and pausing for a moment before realising I am where I need to work. This is a first world problem for which I don’t believe there is a solution.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2011/03/31/a-survey-of-hype-in-web-development-podcasts">A Survey of Hype in Web Development Podcasts</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">31 Mar 2011</div>
	<p>I listen to quite a few web dev podcasts. Something that irks me about a lot of them, is how much they tend to hype their own shows, products or the like. Sure, they’re allowed to, it is their own podcast after all, often from their own businesses etc. I’m fully aware this all possibly contributes toward the success of shows, but it annoys me nonetheless. </p>

<p>One of these things is the title of the show itself. I don’t really get why its necessary to repeat the title (Sure I do really, to drum it into my head), given it’s going to be within the title of the mp3. I know what I’m listening to after all, because my favourite media player tells me. </p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to count the number of times a show utters it’s name over its duration. Sure, I realise this is somewhat ocd and geeky, but hey. Here’s my results for a typical set of podcasts that I often listen to in a week. I’ve linked up the data I’ve used to create this chart on <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiyMcCUnltKwdG85QnNKMnhneUVXMjJNUzVCa0kzNEE&#038;hl=en&#038;pli=1&#038;authkey=CJbb9a0L#gid=0">google spreadsheets</a>, for anyone else who may be interested to contribute to and build upon further. I gathered the data all myself by listening to each podcast and counting when mentions of the show were made but it may be a good excuse for me to experiment with amazon turk. </p>

<p>The big web show comes out tops with one mention over 40 mins worth of show and boagworld comes last with 24 mentions of the show over its duration. (It’s unfortunate for boagworld that its theme tune includes a voice repeating the title in the theme. I did originally include echos, which would be 34 mentions, but my colleagues inform me this may be taking the experiment a little too far :))</p>

<p>I plan to do the same for product mentions (adverts I guess) in a weeks worth of (different) episodes, but if anyone wants to go ahead and update with their own findings that would be great.</p>
