		   <p>It seems that all I do these days is talk about what’s going on over at <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and if you’re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I’ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what’s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.</p>

<p>We’re holding our <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com/challenge/fairytales">second design challenge</a> right now and calling for designs based around the concept of a unique twist on a fairy tale. The prize is our biggest ever, at £200 + a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS3 (which was kindly donated by one of F&#038;B’s community!). You have until 15th February to both submit a design and get it voted on by the F&#038;B peeps!</p>

<p>It looks like I’ve also failed to mention over here the winner of our Snowdodgers competition as the amazing <a href="http://www.mistershrew.co.uk">Mister Shrew</a>. The shirts we printed look amazing and you should pick one up now if you haven’t already.</p>
