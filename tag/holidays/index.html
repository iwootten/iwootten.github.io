          <p>Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&#8217;s never had a home before and we&#8217;ve never owned it. Anyway, suffice to say things are busy &#8211; which might explain my not being about. Sorry if you feel you&#8217;ve been missing out&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Jul 2006</div>

          <p>So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).</p>
<p>Then theres that other little thing, of my engagement to Viv, which is extremely exciting. We snuck off together to climb the hill during the afternoon and returned engaged seeing if anyone would notice the ring upon Vivs finger. Oh the children we are. She&#8217;d kind of seen it coming, but was still a little taken aback that it was happening for real I think. While I don&#8217;t know what the future holds for either of us, I do know that I want to spend it together.  </p>

          <p>Woohoo, rock on &#8211; its almost holiday season for me. Next week I&#8217;ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh&#8230;Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I&#8217;ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who&#8217;ll be there with me &#8211; you best make it a good&#8217;n.</p>

          <p>Our last day in Jard was rather less exciting than we&#8217;d hoped, we decided to clean the place* we were staying in, so spent the morning doing that and unfortunately the weather was cack so didn&#8217;t make for much of an afternoon either. We apparently caught the back end of a heatwave this week which has been rather fortunate, although pretty uncomfortable in the evenings. (Tim had it worse being in the same room as Mr &#8216;Exorcist&#8217; Pete, I had to endure that in Germany so it&#8217;s his turn this time). In the evening we had a final celebratory meal, before heading off on Saturday&#8230;.</p>
<p>Finally we complete the trip in reverse mode, go up France, get separated from convoy, get lost in a different city, randomly meet up in city, get lost again in same city, find desired route, randomly meet again at services, get to Calais, hotel, sleep, brekkie, chunnel, motorway, Reading, food, lost camera, find camera, motorway, Cardiff. Yay! no trying to speak a language I&#8217;ve never been taught! Back to work tomoz. I&#8217;m tired. Night.</p>

    *We also cleaned the place the next day before we left, before being booted out by a woman who&#8217;d been sent to clean (doh!).

      <div class="author_meta">23 Jun 2005</div>

          <p>Yesterday not a lot happened, except for much reading and bumming around the house whilst trying out my newly found juggling skills. We also went on our search for pastis, after discovering that it actually tasted much the same as oizo, a wicked aniseed flavour&#8230;I think Rach may need to be educated in its use however, due to filling a wine glass neat with the stuff, which I would of been dead if I&#8217;d actually consumed undiluted, or at least extremely quiet for the rest of the evening.</p>
<p>Today we split our separate ways with Heledd, Dave and I continuing a previously started &#8216;Amazing Microworld&#8217; Adventure with a visit to the miniature museum in Vendee. The previous adventure, started in Bath a couple of years back was claimed to be amazing &#8216;or your money back&#8217;, we were determined to not be impressed, but alas could not contain ourselves &#8211; something like those actimel adverts. Therefore, we didn&#8217;t feel it proper to try and claim our money back. Although todays trip was slightly less impressive (much larger) it was still a laugh.</p>
<p>We spent our afternoon on the beach again &#8211; you&#8217;d think the locals had never seen a frisbee, or maybe thats the way we were playing. Last day tomorrow, best make the most of it!</p>
