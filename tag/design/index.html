      <div class="author_meta">20 Nov 2012</div>

          <p>Given there&#8217;s a bit of lovefilm bashing <a href="http://www.tomalloyd.com/lovefilm-hate-email/">going on in Wales</a> at the moment, I thought I&#8217;d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm. </p>
<p>Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I&#8217;ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/emailpublic/cmsnewsletter/uk-newsletter/LOVEFiLM-Newsletter/2012/Newsletter-Issue-No-409?cid=lfnl409tlweb&#038;brand=lovefilm"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Read-Newsletter-Issue-409-5.jpg" alt="" title="Read Newsletter Issue 409 5" width="470" height="906" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-569" /></a></p>
<p>I really couldn&#8217;t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema&#8217;s to perform reviews and certainly don&#8217;t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image. </p>
<p>Also, the first thing I&#8217;m drawn to is the image. Why lead me away from the title of that movie and make work to find the text for the heading? Don&#8217;t make the title and preview exactly the same size, or divide them up!</p>
<p>End of rant.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">23 Jan 2012</div>

          <p>Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for <a href="http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures 2012</a>. I&#8217;d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn&#8217;t miss a thing.</p>
<p>Colly and his team had done a lovely job of organising enough to keep us busy what with bowling, screenprinting, fr00tball, the after party and of course the main event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small.jpg"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="The Albert Hall" width="640" height="480" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515" /></a></p>
<p>Despite not actually branding myself as a web designer, it was great to feel welcomed and able to chat one on one with others about our day to day work. Dan Mall&#8217;s talked helped somewhat here, forcing introductions with everyone around me. I&#8217;m pretty much work in solitary confinement as a developer and to discuss the thoughts and ideas I have with other like minded creatives is always welcome.</p>
<p>During a dinner following the conference, another dev commented that the most of the presentations weren&#8217;t specific to web design. They were in fact so abstract, that it was more a &#8220;Self Help Class for Web Designers&#8221;. I pretty much agree with this. But that&#8217;s with a caveat &#8211; what else do you attend these presentations for? NA Conf is there to share, inspire and enable designers to be better designers. I want to leave giddy eyed with possibilities. Remember there are workshops too for specifics&#8230;</p>
<p>After the whole conference, I feel like there&#8217;s a whole lot more I could do to better myself at my craft. Hopefully over the course of the year I&#8217;ll do something about it. Most of the notes I made are to this effect too and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll take away something different each time I look at them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only so much that can be covered in 45 mins, and for me I want to see a speaker paint me the big picture. After NAConf, I&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of big pictures to get through.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2008</div>

          <p>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I&#8217;m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with <a href="http://fairdos.com">fairdos</a> and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don&#8217;t appeal to us at all. Some of these friends are people who are right up there within prominent fairtrade companies, who although avid promoters, won&#8217;t wear fairtrade on a day to day basis if it means they have to sacrifice their style. It seems that the fairtrade companies don&#8217;t do design and so we&#8217;re not given a choice between two similar products. The end result is we&#8217;re faced with looking great and feeling a little discontent that the garment isn&#8217;t as fantastic as it could be, or feeling great about a product &#8211; but not looking so awesome. We&#8217;ve often spoken of beginning a fairtrade company that puts out clothing that is both ethically produced and well designed, but held off doing so because it felt a little beyond us. I can say here now that we&#8217;ve made the first step in bringing that vision a little closer.</p>
<p><a href="http://fairandbare.com">Fair and Bare</a> is a crowdsourcing project which pays out comission to designers who successfully produce t shirt design ideas for fairtrade t shirts. It&#8217;s also an attempt for the fairtrade community to lose that somewhat &#8216;serious face&#8217; with which I think they are often associated and relax the shoulders a bit whilst having some fun. We&#8217;re currently offering £200 for designs and £50 for design ideas which we think are worth printing up onto fairtrade cotton. We then hope to offer shirts at a somewhat more accessible price than other fairtrade shirts. It&#8217;s a fun, small project at the moment, but I hope that we can help rejuvinate an otherwise awesome product and maybe inspire others to do the same.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">11 Sep 2007</div>

          <p>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my &#8220;business&#8221; cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing &#8220;beta&#8221; on hand hand-made ones or something&#8230;</p>
