      <description>When running some Cypress tests in Github Actions that were inspecting dates recently, I wanted to be able to set the locale of the browser - specifically for Chrome which I was using with Cypress.
The tests checked the date format of dd/mm/yyyy and ran fine locally in my own locale of Great Britain, but when Github executed them they appeared in a mm/dd/yyyy format.
Originally, I’d thought this require a step within setting up the github action environment itself which set my linux box to have the appropriate locale, but this doesn’t change anything - presumably because the Cypress github action runs in a separate step.</description>
