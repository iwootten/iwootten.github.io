    <p>This weekend, I released my first ever digital product. It&rsquo;s only been available for 2 days and is already my most successful product ever with a grand total of 3 sales, yielding a massive $15! I jest, but this is all totally true. In the past I&rsquo;ve run a web hosting service, a <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/tags/tshirts/">TShirt company</a> before becoming an employee and then freelance developer 10 years ago. I still have boxes of tshirts that I haven&rsquo;t sold and none of my previous product ventures have made me a profit. In part this is what led on to freelancing and contracting which I&rsquo;ve had far more success with over the last decade. The only actual &ldquo;thing&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve released and made actual money from, is this product.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://niftydigits.gumroad.com/l/side-projects">&ldquo;Side Projects Making $$$+&quot;</a> - a list of 180+ side projects posted to Hacker News threads since 2017, available as a number of Notion documents which has taken me a huge amount of time to organise. I started looking through these threads at every story and found each and every one incredibly inspiring. I had a huge grin on my face as I read through them. For some reason I decided to put them into a Notion spreadsheet (or database) categorising every single one that had details of MRR and tagging/categorising them to be searchable.</p>
<p>I thought other developers might like them too and probably would appreciate them being organised, so decided to release it as a product on gumroad for a small price of £1+ to see what other devs thought. It would seem a few people like the idea enough to buy it.</p>
<p>This past weekend has been fairly crazy. I finished the product late on Friday and decided to launch on Saturday morning. I then decided to <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/side-projects-making">launch on Product Hunt</a> on Sunday. Although $15 may not be the massive numbers you usually hear about on Indie Hackers or Product Hunt I think it&rsquo;s all useful process to have gone through and for me to learn from.</p>
<p>The nice part about a digital product is I can improve on it over time. It isn&rsquo;t something that need be fixed once released like something physical like a tshirt. I can just jump into Notion and make a change and my customers will immediately receive that. I plan to write a summary with my take on each year listed within, with a report on the categories that did the best. I&rsquo;d like to highlight some of the stories that resonate most with me. I&rsquo;ll likely review and increase the price once all that&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re a dev who is keen to learn from these stories, then take a look at the link below.</p>
