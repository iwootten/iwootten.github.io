      <description>This weekend, I released my first ever digital product. It&amp;rsquo;s only been available for 2 days and is already my most successful product ever with a grand total of 3 sales, yielding a massive $15! I jest, but this is all totally true. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve run a web hosting service, a TShirt company before becoming an employee and then freelance developer 10 years ago. I still have boxes of tshirts that I haven&amp;rsquo;t sold and none of my previous product ventures have made me a profit.</description>
