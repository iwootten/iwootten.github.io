    <p>I got the Valve Steam Deck last month and have instantly become obsessed with it. I wanted to know if I could use it as a linux dev machine, knowing that it was essentially a full blown PC under the hood. You&rsquo;re able to be use a keyboard and mouse with SteamOS in desktop mode with everything setup over the sole USB-C port via a dongle.</p>
<h2 id="user-setup">User Setup</h2>
<p>SteamOS is built upon arch linux, which gives you a familiar environment if you&rsquo;ve used a linux distro before. When you first open a terminal, you&rsquo;ll notice that you&rsquo;re logged in as &ldquo;<strong>deck</strong>&rdquo;. This is the sole user and has full access to everything on the device with no password restriction by default. If you want to do install anything you&rsquo;ll need to set a password using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">passwd
</code></pre></div><h2 id="package-management">Package Management</h2>
<p>Arch uses pacman as the main package manager. If you install a package with pacman and ever update SteamOS it wipes everything that is not under the /home partition, including any of your packages. This is not ideal if you want to keep it up to date and not reinstall packages afterwards.</p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="https://brew.sh">brew</a>, which will install packages under /home/. Brew will be familiar to you if you&rsquo;ve ever needed to install dev tools on MacOS since it doesn&rsquo;t have it&rsquo;s own package manager. Brew has a single command for installation:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">/bin/bash -c <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span><span style="color:#66d9ef">$(</span>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh<span style="color:#66d9ef">)</span><span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Following this there will be a couple of subsequent steps to add it to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file in order to correctly resolve paths. I found that <code>konsole</code> did not pick up the path and also copied it over to my <code>~/.bashrc</code> in order to proceed.</p>
<h2 id="python-and-virtual-environments">Python and Virtual Environments</h2>
<p>Using brew I&rsquo;ve been successfully install pipenv and use it to manage python dependencies. You can do the same using the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">brew install pipenv
</code></pre></div><p>I also installed pyenv and docker via brew, although pyenv fails when trying to compile python and docker appears to require a docker daemon installation via pacman (something which would get removed).</p>
<h2 id="vscode">VSCode</h2>
<p>VSCode is available using the application store on the deck though it&rsquo;s apparently &lsquo;unofficial&rsquo;. I found that after installation the file dialog appeared behind the main vscode window which had me scratching my head for a second. I was able to install extensions which gave me intellisense output for projects and dependencies.</p>
<p>In order to get the terminal working correctly with brew it was necessary to change the <code>Terminal &gt; Integrated &gt; Default Profile &gt; Linux</code> to bash, so that the changes to the <code>~/.bashrc</code> would be read.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I found that it&rsquo;s certainly possible to get up and running with Python on the deck along with familiar tooling. Without the ability to switch python versions and run docker it&rsquo;s likely only something I&rsquo;d want to use for basic work but is certainly capable if you&rsquo;re just starting to learn. I&rsquo;m going to continue experimenting and learning whats possible with it and will post updates here and to my youtube channel.</p>
