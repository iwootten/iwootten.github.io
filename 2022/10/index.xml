      <description>I got the Valve Steam Deck last month and have instantly become obsessed with it. I wanted to know if I could use it as a linux dev machine, knowing that it was essentially a full blown PC under the hood. You&amp;rsquo;re able to be use a keyboard and mouse with SteamOS in desktop mode with everything setup over the sole USB-C port via a dongle.
User Setup SteamOS is built upon arch linux, which gives you a familiar environment if you&amp;rsquo;ve used a linux distro before.</description>

      <description>I watched a video earlier this week by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker. It’s an entertaining walkthrough of some impressive optimisation of his own Python code by his community but there&amp;rsquo;s a comment about Python that I thought warranted some pushback.
That comment was that ‘Python will very rarely make it into production’. The implication being that it’s a language used only really for prototyping at which point you’ll bring out the raw grunt of another language - such as C++ or C to do some real work.</description>
