      <description>This past weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve been attending PyCon UK. I&amp;rsquo;m particularly lucky in that I live a 10 min train ride from where it is located in Cardiff meaning its incredibly convenient and economic for me. As a Python dev located here, there&amp;rsquo;s literally no excuse not to attend.
What makes it even more special this time round is that this is the first event since the pandemic started - the last being held in 2019.</description>

      <description>I found with a new poetry install that it refused to use the pyenv version of Python.
I needed to explicitly tell Poetry where to find the active pyenv:
poetry env use -- $(which python) After this, it works as expected.
