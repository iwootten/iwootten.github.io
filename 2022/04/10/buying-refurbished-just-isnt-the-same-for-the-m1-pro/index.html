    <p>Over the last 11 Years, I&rsquo;ve gone from PC die hard to owning 4 different Macs for development. There&rsquo;s one place I&rsquo;ve bought them all over this time and that&rsquo;s through the Apple Certified Refurbished store (<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished">US</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished">UK</a>). If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, this is where Apple resells returned hardware which has undergone a thorough certification process at a discount to customers. Best of all, it comes with the same 1 year warranty as if you bought it brand new from Apple. This is over all of their products, including Macs, iPhones, iPads and the Apple watch.</p>
<p>As a rule Apple refurbished versions of their new counterparts tend to start appearing in the store 6 months after their original launch date. Do you remember which product launched 6 months ago? That&rsquo;s right - the M1 Pro and Max version of the MacBook Pro!</p>
<p>Both models have started appearing in the refurb store last week, only they aren&rsquo;t quite the deal as other MacBook models there - at only 10% off of their retail price vs 15% of other models. This means the 512GB base model costs $1799/£1709 with a $200/£180 discount, with the 1TB version being $2249/£2159 with a $250/£240 discount at the US and UK stores respectively. This is an especially bitter pill to swallow when retailers such as Amazon have dropped the <a href="https://amzn.to/38Hg07d">1TB base model</a> to currently 11% off at £2155 here in the UK - so you can get it cheaper new from Amazon than refurbished from Apple. Good old Apple! The 16&quot; 1TB is even available at £2234 <a href="https://amzn.to/3Js4BF2">from Amazon here in the UK today</a> so a massive £365 or 14% off the retail price.</p>
<p>Back in October, I mused that I probably didn&rsquo;t need to upgrade to the M1 Pro at the time <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NrtzDI88-I">over on YouTube</a> instead opting for them to be discounted in the refurb store. Even with the smaller discount, now that Apple have revealed their hand - I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and upgraded my 2015 model to a custom 2021 14&quot; 8 core, 1TB version. This remains the cheapest way to get a 1TB version of this model at £269 less than the <a href="https://amzn.to/38Hg07d">10 core, 1TB version</a> from Amazon. I have no need for the bump in cores and based on my previous experience I think that the M1 Pro is going to be as good as I&rsquo;ve come to expect from any other product from the refurb store.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested - it&rsquo;s just turned up and I&rsquo;ve just published an unboxing to my YouTube channel.</p>
