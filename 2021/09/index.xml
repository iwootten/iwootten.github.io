      <description>I got fed up recently of the insane number of requests that were given over to my use of disqus here on my blog. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it enabled since moving from Wordpress to various other blogging engines, wanting to take my comments with me to a static blogging engine, but enough is enough. I remember disqus being a darling in the startup scene when it first launched in 2007 but it&amp;rsquo;s changed hands several times since and the idea that randoms ads may turn up on my blog at some point is a massive turn off.</description>

      <description>This week, I revealed mixes.it - a very simple site I&amp;rsquo;ve created for indexing DJ mixes scraped from the web. I wanted a no-frills site that I could get Spotify playlists of DJ&amp;rsquo;s I like to see what new music they were playing and that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to spend much time supporting.
I used Astro and Supabase to create the site itself and the whole thing is currently built using Netlify.</description>
