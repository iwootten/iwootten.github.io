      <description>This Christmas, I decided to make our tree lights incredibly complex so that I could marvel at my own animations running on them. That&amp;rsquo;s tongue and cheek, but also ended up being very true.
I&amp;rsquo;d been inspired by mathematician Matt Parker in 2020 where he did this. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe all the hardware I used and how it was connected and I&amp;rsquo;ll share the code I needed to write to capture the LED&amp;rsquo;s coordinates.</description>
