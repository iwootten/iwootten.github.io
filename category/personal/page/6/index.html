      <div class="author_meta">29 Nov 2005</div>

          <p>I spent the weekend back at home in recognition of my parents 30th wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s quite bizarre looking through their wedding photos (I&#8217;d never seen them before) and picking out all my relatives in mini form. Said previous ladyfriend decided she&#8217;d brave the border as well to make those &#8220;all important&#8221; first introductions. She might of thought better of it if she knew parentals were going to bring their saturday night party back to ours and keep everyone awake until the early hours.</p>
<p>I got to see all my fabulous pals as well as witness the dedication of Jase and Stephs daughter Eden at the service on Sunday with lots of fireworks type &#8220;ooh&#8217;s and ahh&#8217;s&#8221; from the elderly members to express her cuteness. As a gesture of thanks, the Helyars bought everyone there a doughnut, putting my previous contributions to Vineyard somewhat to shame.</p>
<p>After a detour to clarks village with Paul tagging along (after a number of bump starts &#8211; remember to keep the keys in the ignition mate), we made it back to Cardiff and headed off to see the amazing Prodigy. I was so tired by now it was ridiculous, I used to remember home as a quiet place, it didn&#8217;t seem to be the case this visit but still somehow managed to roll up at the CIA. The warm up act (Audio Bully&#8217;s) really sucked big time, and it was quite amusing to hear the roar as the first track from the dj&#8217;s came on afterwards. Anyway, after feeling suitably psyched, Paul, I and the large group in the bit that formed around us spent the next 2 hours going mental to all the classics, without a black eye in sight. Lot&#8217;s of fond childhood memories came flooding back of music sharing in Pauls living room. Twas brill it twas.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I&#8217;d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it&#8217;s quite the opposite really.</p>
<p>My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it&#8217;s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase. If you download or copy cd&#8217;s with no intention of rewarding those who created it with payment of some way shape or form, I&#8217;m sorry, I really can&#8217;t see it as a good thing. You might argue that fat cats mark up media with artificially high prices, with little going to the original artists, but it&#8217;s untrue for the most part (there are a huge number of people involved in producing most albums) and goes a short way as to why you should award those artists with no payment whatsoever&#8230;these artists do after all sign contracts and know what they&#8217;re getting themselves into for the most part.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are occasions where my opinions blur. In the case of mix cd&#8217;s, I see the cd as a showcase for the DJ&#8217;s mixing skills, as well as those songs upon it, so I&#8217;d quite happily download mixes from the net. If there is a good track within, I&#8217;ll add it to my collection anyway, the majority of the dance music scene seems to encourage these methods anyway &#8211; getting their artists to produce mixes and distribute them online so people buy the bare, unmixed, tracks. It gets really messy with the issue of sampling &#8211; I&#8217;m not even going there&#8230;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a little more scary, is the attitude Christians take to piracy. I&#8217;ve known in the past Christians quite happily pirating software worth thousands to produce albums or websites for projects in the Church, with little or no concern for what they&#8217;re doing. Surely there&#8217;s something wrong there &#8211; making Church websites with stolen software? The majority of the time its simply not necessary for the tasks in hand either, there are other ways of achieving the results in a more ethical way. (Ask me if you want to know how)&#8230; I&#8217;m probably more sensitive in this area, due to the fact I create software myself.</p>
<p>I was really disturbed when I first got into sharing applications as a teenager at the volume of Christian music available, Delerious, Redman, Jars of Clay, you want it its there&#8230;it seems we&#8217;re just as bad as the rest of the world here. The Gospel Music Association even has the stats to <a href="http://www.cmta.com/research.htm" title="GMA">prove it</a>. The Bible calls for us to &#8216;abide by the laws of the land&#8217; because such authorities &#8216;have been established by God&#8217; (Romans 13:1-7) &#8211; if we&#8217;re going against them we&#8217;re going against God. I can&#8217;t see that laws for copyrighting music, films go against what God says, so really we have no reason for being so lax in this department.</p>
<p>I was reading a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0851112587/qid%3D1122935165/026-6844478-8087659" title="Amazon">Net Commandments</a> back along which describes how easy technology has made it for us to sin (or cybersin &#8211; but that sounds like you need a peripheral). Not only this, but its also removed a large majority of the barriers which have been in place which otherwise may have presented us from sinning. I&#8217;d love to see some of us going into Virgin and using our MD to record the album we&#8217;re sampling at the listening point, it&#8217;d never happen.</p>

          <p>So, in the absence of students, life continues as normal for the various research teams down here in the Queens buildings. We wake, march to University and sit in our little boxes reading, theorising and tearing our hair out until 5 o&#8217;clock when we march back, only to be repeated the next day. I hate routines&#8230;</p>
<p>Today marked the graduation of Year 3&#8242;s which brought back memories of my graduation last year, which was pretty depressing to be honest. It allows me to reflect how far I&#8217;ve come in the last year or so and how I&#8217;ve not nearly amounted to that image I&#8217;d be content with at the beginning of my degree and how perhaps my values have changed. It also made me to look at how much older I am than the vast majority of my colleagues and how different life would have been coming to uni a year earlier. I know the whole experience of that extra couple of years at home was beneficial to me and I was placed there for a reason, but it doesn&#8217;t half make me feel inadequate against some of my current pool of mates. This combined with the current lack of air conditioning in our lab and mini-heatwave (we reached 33 degrees) doesn&#8217;t make it easy to keep to any train of thought for extended periods.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder where I&#8217;ll be in the next year&#8230;.</p>
<p>Oh &#8211; I know! &#8230;&#8230;. right here sat at my desk</p>

          <p>Today I travelled on 2 planes, 3 buses and 1 car (thats a full house and extra) to make the 800 mile round trip to Edinburgh for part of a <a href="http://www.bdworld.org">BioDiveristyWorld</a> conference. I&#8217;m quite surprised I managed to organise and sort out everything since Monday and it go according to plan.</p>
<p>I was actually really overwhelmed at how amazing the place was for the brief time I was there, the sheer scale of the city was something else. Too bad I couldn&#8217;t stick about for the G8 conference and related protests/festivals, despite comments about riots being thrown around, it would of been something to tell the kids. Anyways, I&#8217;ve got Steve and Hannah&#8217;s wedding back home to go to on Saturday. The 5:00am start has not been the best thing for me though, I will sleep like the proverbial log tonight.</p>

          <p>Our last day in Jard was rather less exciting than we&#8217;d hoped, we decided to clean the place* we were staying in, so spent the morning doing that and unfortunately the weather was cack so didn&#8217;t make for much of an afternoon either. We apparently caught the back end of a heatwave this week which has been rather fortunate, although pretty uncomfortable in the evenings. (Tim had it worse being in the same room as Mr &#8216;Exorcist&#8217; Pete, I had to endure that in Germany so it&#8217;s his turn this time). In the evening we had a final celebratory meal, before heading off on Saturday&#8230;.</p>
<p>Finally we complete the trip in reverse mode, go up France, get separated from convoy, get lost in a different city, randomly meet up in city, get lost again in same city, find desired route, randomly meet again at services, get to Calais, hotel, sleep, brekkie, chunnel, motorway, Reading, food, lost camera, find camera, motorway, Cardiff. Yay! no trying to speak a language I&#8217;ve never been taught! Back to work tomoz. I&#8217;m tired. Night.</p>

    *We also cleaned the place the next day before we left, before being booted out by a woman who&#8217;d been sent to clean (doh!).
