          <p>Doing household bills is extremely boring. I just spent two hours dividing up the phone bill and working out who owes what. If marriage brings me anything, at least it will bring me less of a headache when it comes to doing the bills.</p>

          <p>Currently <a href="http://vivvyenna.com">Viv</a> and I are planning our wedding for later in the year, which aside from being the most exciting thing ever, is really, really stressful. Apparently though, there are <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/jobs/index.php?job=84">wed designers</a> about, though I never realised.</p>

          <p>Did you not know? I&#8217;m going to hit the grand old age of 26 soon. Whooah, thats like ancient. If you want some ideas of what you can get me (I obviously expect a gift), why not check my gift list <a href="http://gifttagging.com/scrumpyjack">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2ZGQU6TDBXOYL/203-4356029-7279932">here</a>, to save the embarrasment of some really awful gift.</p>

          <p>It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that I <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/10/13/ow-my-arse">posted about coming off of my bike</a> due to a slippery road, but this time was a bit different. Today somebody properly smacked me off of my bike! They were attempting to cut round a light-enabled junction when the lights had gone green in a different direction. As there is a small window of time only 1 or two generally make this turn, but this car decided that it should go even if it wasn&#8217;t its turn. They wheelspun out and clipped my backwheel, kicking my bike out from under me. I promptly leapt to my feet and gave them a whole host of verbal abuse in the middle of the road, before going to meet them where they pulled in. There I explained to them (throught the art of shouting) why attempting the turn was difficult (you are essentially doing a 180 degree turn) and ridiculous when it was the crossing traffic&#8217;s right of way. Their excuses were rather pathetic to say the least, and I told them that even if they &#8216;didn&#8217;t know the area&#8217;, that this should prompt some caution and mowing down cyclists wasn&#8217;t the way to go to make friends.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe some people, this is the first time I&#8217;ve physically been struck by a vehicle and was a really stupid mistake.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">13 Oct 2006</div>

          <p>For the 3rd time I can remember ever I came off my bike this morning. I took a corner too sharply and ended up sliding across the road. So I am currently sitting here with gravel ridden hands and a really sore arse. I thought to go and check my arse when I finally arrived at uni and decided that it might be an idea to find something to stop the injury oozing all over my underwear. Much to the amusement of the staff in reception who commented that they&#8217;d be able to help me apply first aid, but both of them would need to attend as they were of the opposite sex. I decided to go ahead and apply it myself. A wound dressing might be slightly overkill, but hopefully more comfortable when I return home.</p>
<p>It hurts.</p>
