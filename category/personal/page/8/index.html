      <div class="author_meta">22 Apr 2005</div>

          <p>Having free time in the evenings recently is a wonderful thing, and its given me the chance to think about &#8216;stuff&#8217; I might not of done otherwise, recently its been my undergrad life. When I came to University, I was all fired up for an amazing walk through Christendom, I tried to throw myself into the Christian Union, and for a while it was great. Unfortunately my work got a grip of me very quickly, and for all the wrong reasons I backed off from CU and any kind of fellowship with others. I didn&#8217;t really settle at any Church well here and the year I spent at home made it even worse by becoming more disjointed from my Cardiff life&#8230;.</p>
<p>I got my degree, and a good one at that, but I can&#8217;t help but think I put myself through hell (this time last year was awful for me) for absolutely zero benefit over what could have been. I know I&#8217;ve been taken down this path for a reason and while I might think there wasn&#8217;t anything going on, the whole experience is a lesson in discipline in itself.</p>
<p>Changing churches and attending a housegroup this year has been great, I&#8217;ve made some fantastic friends and its pushed me forward in ways I wouldn&#8217;t of thought possible, building me (and I hope others) up with far more on the horizon. Anyway, suffice to say reflecting on this hasn&#8217;t been great for me this week, but I&#8217;ve also felt encouraged by a few words I&#8217;ve been given of late about my character&#8230;trying to be a little more confident and forthcoming about my feelings, due to my unique slant on the world.</p>

          <p>Cardiff Vineyard have got to be the biggest bunch of bloggers I&#8217;ve ever met, in a non-derogitory sense. Makes a change to Yeovil Community Church. Browsing around their main site and links from it, I&#8217;ve found, hmm, lets see:</p>

<p>Thats crazy&#8230;.! &#8211; We&#8217;ve got say 25 ppl max when I&#8217;ve gone along, so thats over a 5th turned blogging converts. There are more, but I&#8217;ve not actually met them, or if I have I&#8217;ve not remembered their names! Quite reassuring to know that systems such as the one I did for my dissertation are being used out there. I expect YCC has like 5 people blogging in some shape or form, yet the Church is maybe 10 &#8211; 20 times that size. Talk about cutting edge&#8230;..</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been totally caning it over the last week or so&#8230;. I&#8217;ve got this Opengl graphics project due in very soon, and I&#8217;ve been working like a bit of a bandit on it. On the other side of the coin, I&#8217;ve got a databases piece due in on the same day which I haven&#8217;t made a start on yet. Guess I&#8217;ll be doing that over the weekend. Those will be in next week and then I&#8217;ll have some time to get moving on my project again&#8230;.</p>
<p>I got a couple of pieces of coursework since I last wrote.. First I got full marks for Graphics, which I was quite chuffed about, but it was pretty easy. Secondly, I got my paradigms coursework back and was absolutely gutted as I only got like 55% (accounting for 20% of my overall mark). So I&#8217;ve already lost 10% without even beginning the exam. I&#8217;ve been a bit cut up about that for a while. Ah well, I&#8217;ll have to try and make it up on the exam. I did do pretty well on the last course I took with Ralph so the crazy amount of notes I&#8217;m taking must be doing some good.</p>

          <p>Oh dear, today has not been good&#8230;</p>
<p>After missing Church this morning, I proceeded to backup most of my hard disk onto my old ATA100 so that I could revert my main ATA150 partition back to a &#8220;simple&#8221; partition, so I <em>might </em> be able to install Linux.</p>
<p>After spending the best part of the afternoon backing up, I proceeded to download a partition tool to manage my partitions if Linux couldn&#8217;t handle it. I fired it up to take a look and thought it might be a good idea to tidy up my old disk while I was there ready for Tim&#8217;s pc when I build it. That proved to be an extremely bad idea&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>The merge operation failed &#8211; causing xp to have a fit on reboot, scanning the whole of my h/d. After that, (maybe an hour or so), a reboot showed nothing on either disk &#8211; oh dear&#8230;.</p>
<p>After spending the majority of the evening trying to get Dave&#8217;s pc (after a Mandrake install) to see my now buggered hard drive, I gave up and reformatted the whole disk. Now I have to recoup about 6 month&#8217;s worth of lost downloads&#8230;</p>
<p>Maybe I should of made the effort to get to Church&#8230;&#8230;seems I am being persecuted&#8230;&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">03 Oct 2003</div>

          <p>After having my account removed (presumably because I should&#8217;ve theoretically graduated by now), making the move up to Cardiff, having my account reinstated and finally finding out that the web hosting had changed servers, with the mysql databases remaining on the same server (meaning that I had to change the &#8220;99% of the time you won&#8217;t need to change this&#8221; value) I am now able to have b2 back up and running smoothly.</p>
<p>I guess now might be a good time to let you know whats been going on the past month or so.</p>
<p>Have spent most of my time in Cardiff trying to get various bits and bobs with our network funtional. </p>
<p>First of all there was a bit of a snag getting our ISP sorted. In a bid to fire a big &#8220;up yours&#8221; across NTL&#8217;s bow and their 1Gb cap, and to make a point to the rest of the student population of Cardiff realise that there isn&#8217;t just a single ISP in Cardiff &#8211; we decided to get ADSL.</p>
<p>This in turn meant getting a phone line with BT, as the original one had been disconnected as the residents before had been with NTL. We had to sign up for a 3 month minimum contract to get connected again. Sorted. Now for ADSL&#8230;..</p>
<p>We&#8217;d already figured that Pipex were the ones to go with, weighing in all costs for disconnection when we leave and all. Onto their website to sign up, bung in new BT phone no&#8230;.boom &#8220;You have got ADSL enabled on your exchange, but you are too far to receive it&#8221;, uh-oh &#8211; and the realisation starts hitting that if we can&#8217;t get ADSL, we&#8217;re stuffed for at least 3 months, as we need to get the phone line with NTL too&#8230;.(I spose we could of had two phone lines, but thats a bit much)&#8230;</p>
<p>So, what to do&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>hang on what this ?? &#8211; &#8220;Pipex Extended Reach Trial&#8221; &#8211; Apparently BT have been conducting extended reach trials for ADSL since about June &#8217;03 for those out of reach from their exchange&#8217;s. What the hell, give it a go, got no better options&#8230;.after moping around worrying loads with all 3 of my housemates packing it at the prospect of no broadband for 3 months, finally get conformation from Pipex to say ADSL will be enabled &#8211; the very next day! Wohoo!</p>
<p>So we&#8217;ve (or I, as we don&#8217;t have a router/server for a bit) have happily been using Pipex for the past week, lovely&#8230;got it in time to say a Happy 21st Birthday to my sis in Mississippi! and safe in the knowledge that she had received my pukker &#8220;Save Ferris&#8221; T Shirt I lovingly picked out for her.</p>
<p>So now we await on ebuyer&#8230;.once again. So that I can build my pc into a new beast (new case, dvd, graphics card and floppy) and sell Sparksy my old one. Then we can use his old 166 as a router over at the girls, and get back Daves old 266 to be the router here (we need USB ports on ours for the modem). On a side note, smoothwall looks to be well easy to set up, except for its compatibility probs with old ISA type network cards as Dave found out last weekend.</p>
<p>It also looks like I&#8217;m travelling to Bristol next week to set up another mates network. I will be knackered by the weekend &#8211; Adam Freeland, Unkle, Mr Scruff and DJ Format are all playing in Cardiff next week&#8230;&#8230;killer&#8230;</p>
