          <p>I&#8217;m selling my car, which has been with me for the last 4/5 years and always been very reliable. It&#8217;s a very nice Vauxhall Corsa 1.5 TD in red, for more details, check freeads <a href="http://cars.uk.freeads.net/1994_L_reg_VAUXHALL_CORSA-229570.htm">here</a> and drop me an email either through freeads or this website if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sad to see the thing go, but as I now have no need for it due to the acquiring of my own personal chauffeur, it seems a bit uneconomical to hang on to it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">12 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>Another post about ubuntu? Where will it end?I was fairly excited from thursday evenings antics of getting things working on my machine at home, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try with my dev machine at uni. My graphics card, a 9600 (yes ATI, I know!) had been screwed since the day I&#8217;d put on Dapper, and to be honest, as I&#8217;m not using it that much for GL stuff, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered about it. After installing the ATI drivers, them not working and reinstalling the fglrx xorg drivers, I managed to get it working nicely within about 30 mins. <a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide" title="Unofficial ATI Linux Driver Wiki">This wiki page</a> may help if you&#8217;re experiencing similar problems. In my case, my driver was loading, but I was having a problem with libdri.a menaing 3d acceleration got switched off. Anyway, glxgears is now shuvving out a good 3000+ fps so I&#8217;m happy enough with that.Aha, I thought, I&#8217;ll give the soundcard a bash &#8211; a 6 year old SBLive Platinum complete with live drive. Although this (with some tweaking in alsamixer) give outputs on the pci card, the front bay wasn&#8217;t getting any output to the headphone socket. I tried to install and compile the latest emu10k drivers from <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/" title="Advanced Linux Sound Architecture">alsa</a>, but then everything got screwed up and no drivers were loading. I removed them and reinstalled what I had before. I carried on with my troubles, inspecting my front bay for any connection problems, notcing one fairly major one&#8230;..having the headphones in the mic input &#8211; doh! I&#8217;d do well to check the obvious things first in the future.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">10 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>It seems I may have spoken too soon about my linux joys with ubuntu. After performing a dist-upgrade on my previous beta version of Dapper, I discovered I&#8217;d have to go through the same problems of downloading kernel source and linux header packages for my new kernel version.I also discovered after doing this that actually there were further problems on booting Dapper straight up. Apparently the pointers to drives get screwed up somewhere in the process. Although I could boot into X using just the safety mode and booting from there, this wasn&#8217;t ideal and I still wanted my lovely little 64 bit install to be working nicely. I dicovered that adding the line ide=nodma to the line of the reference in grub solved the problem.So I&#8217;m in, great you might think, but oh no &#8211; lets try amarok on for size too&#8230; Amarok (A shiny linux media player I discoved) wasn&#8217;t playing any of my mp3&#8242;s at all, just whizzing through the lot of them. A short search revealed that in using the xine engine, xine needed further codecs to be installed to get sound out too. You&#8217;d think that a dependency would be put in place here to sort this out by default. One nice feature I like is the inbuilt submission to last.fm, a great idea in my book &#8211; I use it all the time.Anyway, <em>now </em>my Ubuntu is being nice. Oh no, have I just jinxed it?</p>

          <p>FInally, after a grand total of 10 months, I have a 64bit version of Ubuntu Linux working upon my home machine.This is great news, not only does it mean that I have a wonderful OS to try out for size, but that I can easily convert my subversion server code and latex source to my machine.As I&#8217;ve never mentioned it before, I&#8217;ll detail what the problem was here. First up, the graphics card didn&#8217;t have drivers which were working which meant that my X800 was pretty pathetic to be quite honest with you. There was a fairly simple solution through apt, which would have been nice if&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;the network card on my A8N-VM CSM was working properly, which it wasn&#8217;t, due to use of an NFORCE chipset. A build of some drivers were neccessary, which required adding a load of packages (simple if apt were working!).Anyway, several days of man hours later, and this ubuntu thing works wonderfully. If you&#8217;re having similar troubles with this board, its probably best to use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvNetInstallation" title="Ubuntu NVNet installation">this page</a> for guidance.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Jul 2006</div>

          <p>So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).</p>
<p>Then theres that other little thing, of my engagement to Viv, which is extremely exciting. We snuck off together to climb the hill during the afternoon and returned engaged seeing if anyone would notice the ring upon Vivs finger. Oh the children we are. She&#8217;d kind of seen it coming, but was still a little taken aback that it was happening for real I think. While I don&#8217;t know what the future holds for either of us, I do know that I want to spend it together.  </p>
