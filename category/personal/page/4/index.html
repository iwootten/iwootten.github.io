	<p>Yesterday not a lot happened, except for much reading and bumming around the house whilst trying out my newly found juggling skills. We also went on our search for pastis, after discovering that it actually tasted much the same as oizo, a wicked aniseed flavour…I think Rach may need to be educated in its use however, due to filling a wine glass neat with the stuff, which I would of been dead if I’d actually consumed undiluted, or at least extremely quiet for the rest of the evening.</p>

<p>Today we split our separate ways with Heledd, Dave and I continuing a previously started ‘Amazing Microworld’ Adventure with a visit to the miniature museum in Vendee. The previous adventure, started in Bath a couple of years back was claimed to be amazing ‘or your money back’, we were determined to not be impressed, but alas could not contain ourselves – something like those actimel adverts. Therefore, we didn’t feel it proper to try and claim our money back. Although todays trip was slightly less impressive (much larger) it was still a laugh.</p>

<p>We spent our afternoon on the beach again – you’d think the locals had never seen a frisbee, or maybe thats the way we were playing. Last day tomorrow, best make the most of it!</p>

	<p>Decided to make a move on to our next beach today, taking with us a picnic and a load of beer. This one is situated right next to a forest, which was ace for our picnic.</p>

<p>Tim, after 3 years of living with one another has finally managed to teach me to juggle and give me the bug for continuing it. It’s actually easier to learn using boule, forcing you to use correct arm movements, though its a little dangerous on the beach if you have a distinct lack of footwear. There was three of us praticing it on the beach, I think the locals were a little taken aback. I may even bring my unicycle up to er, uni and try and practice atop that. Not that I’ve done that since first year.</p>

<p>Finally got a picture of the Renault ‘Twingo’, which in my opinion looks exactly like one of the baby robots from ‘Batteries Not Included’.</p>

<p>All this french food must be getting to me, during my meal down in the ‘port (- no the one in Jard Sur Mer, not Wales), I was actually photographed inserting something green into my gob (or was I taking it out? – you decide). It’s not that I don’t like salad, it just doesn’t have a lot of flavour, which my brain is fooled into thinking it doesn’t like and tries to wretch it up as with all those other foods.</p>

	<p>Today we went over to the salt marshes in Olonne, it being slightly more manageable weather and all. Tim basically wanted to do a little birdwatching and Heledd and Dave didn’t fancy such french beauty so went to have coffee in a suitable village somewhere. It was really cool, took lots of photos of the strange green murky waters and had a bunch of exercise too. Saw loads of eels while we were there – horrible things writhing about….</p>

<p>Lunch heralded more wine – sweet aperitif’s before and more red during. I’m thinking the rest of the week will hold lots more judging from wine connisieur Dave.. Enlightened myself by making lots of names from pomme frites.</p>

<p>On to another book ‘Life of Pi’ by Yann Martel. Bit weird so far.</p>

	<p>Sunday’s morning events weren’t overly exciting – the weather has been so hot that it would be a bit much to go off and try to do anything. Instead has been a morning of reading (Dahl’s ‘Boy’ – bizzarrely featuring Cardiff, La Rochelle and Somerset within) and people trying to juggle. The afternoon became overcast so we decided to make the trip down to the beach, where Tim, Rach and Pete all got rather dirty trying to recreate a eurotunnel experience, which was destroyed as soon as it was completed by Dave. </p>

<p>People have done a great job of selecting french foods, we’ve had all manner of bread, cheeses and hams while we’ve been here so far and a shedload of wine to boot.</p>

	<p>So, it begins, the holiday season that is and with it my two day trip across England and back down the west coast of France to Jard Su Mer. Todays trip was fairly long, spending two hours bombing down the M4 to meet with the guys in Reading, then a further few to reach the underside of London on the M25, and a bit more to finally bundle over toward the Eurotunnel. The best part was discovery that Pete has finally grown a full-on beard, after years spend with us and 3 inch stubble. Dave, ever being the technophile has brought a couple of CB’s with us so that our car’s can communicate with one another whilst on the road.</p>

<p>After a bit of a confusing time on entry to the eurotunnel, figuring out where exactly we were meant to be, with tons of gates to pass through and a distinct lack of passport checking, we spent the 30 minute trip and viola we’re in France. Driving down the top floor of a train has got to be one of the most surreal experiences I’ve had for a while, reminded me of rebel’s attack on the deathstar. You might be able to see what I mean from the photo’s. Hotel was good – a short trip from the chunnels exit, and out on its own in the middle of nowhere. The hotel decided I must be Dave’s wife. Nice pics of french sunset.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the second day of travelling was rather less exciting, except for the prospect of arrival at our final destination. On anticipatition of the 450 miles that we were to travel today, it was elected that we set of early at 10 and try and cover as much distance as possible. Little were we to know what today would involve – and after a few refills of tanks of fuel (another bizzarre experience, just fill up and keep going – I’ve never had to travel anywhere further that involved more than a tank), payment for numerous motorway use, stopping off for lunch (speaking french to french person for the first time), discovery that CB communication is crap within moving vehicles, loosing the other car and then finding it again in a super-u and starting and finishing Roald Dahl’s ‘Ah Sweet Mystery of Life’ we finally arrived at about 9pm. Sleep is definitely on the agenda now..</p>

<div class="author_meta">22 Apr 2005</div>
	<p>Having free time in the evenings recently is a wonderful thing, and its given me the chance to think about ‘stuff’ I might not of done otherwise, recently its been my undergrad life. When I came to University, I was all fired up for an amazing walk through Christendom, I tried to throw myself into the Christian Union, and for a while it was great. Unfortunately my work got a grip of me very quickly, and for all the wrong reasons I backed off from CU and any kind of fellowship with others. I didn’t really settle at any Church well here and the year I spent at home made it even worse by becoming more disjointed from my Cardiff life….</p>

<p>I got my degree, and a good one at that, but I can’t help but think I put myself through hell (this time last year was awful for me) for absolutely zero benefit over what could have been. I know I’ve been taken down this path for a reason and while I might think there wasn’t anything going on, the whole experience is a lesson in discipline in itself.</p>

<p>Changing churches and attending a housegroup this year has been great, I’ve made some fantastic friends and its pushed me forward in ways I wouldn’t of thought possible, building me (and I hope others) up with far more on the horizon. Anyway, suffice to say reflecting on this hasn’t been great for me this week, but I’ve also felt encouraged by a few words I’ve been given of late about my character…trying to be a little more confident and forthcoming about my feelings, due to my unique slant on the world.</p>

	<p>Cardiff Vineyard have got to be the biggest bunch of bloggers I’ve ever met, in a non-derogitory sense. Makes a change to Yeovil Community Church. Browsing around their main site and links from it, I’ve found, hmm, lets see:</p>

<p>Thats crazy….! – We’ve got say 25 ppl max when I’ve gone along, so thats over a 5th turned blogging converts. There are more, but I’ve not actually met them, or if I have I’ve not remembered their names! Quite reassuring to know that systems such as the one I did for my dissertation are being used out there. I expect YCC has like 5 people blogging in some shape or form, yet the Church is maybe 10 – 20 times that size. Talk about cutting edge…..</p>

	<p>I’ve been totally caning it over the last week or so…. I’ve got this Opengl graphics project due in very soon, and I’ve been working like a bit of a bandit on it. On the other side of the coin, I’ve got a databases piece due in on the same day which I haven’t made a start on yet. Guess I’ll be doing that over the weekend. Those will be in next week and then I’ll have some time to get moving on my project again….</p>

<p>I got a couple of pieces of coursework since I last wrote.. First I got full marks for Graphics, which I was quite chuffed about, but it was pretty easy. Secondly, I got my paradigms coursework back and was absolutely gutted as I only got like 55% (accounting for 20% of my overall mark). So I’ve already lost 10% without even beginning the exam. I’ve been a bit cut up about that for a while. Ah well, I’ll have to try and make it up on the exam. I did do pretty well on the last course I took with Ralph so the crazy amount of notes I’m taking must be doing some good.</p>

	<p>Oh dear, today has not been good…</p>

<p>After missing Church this morning, I proceeded to backup most of my hard disk onto my old ATA100 so that I could revert my main ATA150 partition back to a “simple” partition, so I *might * be able to install Linux.</p>

<p>After spending the best part of the afternoon backing up, I proceeded to download a partition tool to manage my partitions if Linux couldn’t handle it. I fired it up to take a look and thought it might be a good idea to tidy up my old disk while I was there ready for Tim’s pc when I build it. That proved to be an extremely bad idea……</p>

<p>The merge operation failed – causing xp to have a fit on reboot, scanning the whole of my h/d. After that, (maybe an hour or so), a reboot showed nothing on either disk – oh dear….</p>

<p>After spending the majority of the evening trying to get Dave’s pc (after a Mandrake install) to see my now buggered hard drive, I gave up and reformatted the whole disk. Now I have to recoup about 6 month’s worth of lost downloads…</p>

<p>Maybe I should of made the effort to get to Church……seems I am being persecuted……</p>

<div class="author_meta">03 Oct 2003</div>
	<p>After having my account removed (presumably because I should’ve theoretically graduated by now), making the move up to Cardiff, having my account reinstated and finally finding out that the web hosting had changed servers, with the mysql databases remaining on the same server (meaning that I had to change the “99% of the time you won’t need to change this” value) I am now able to have b2 back up and running smoothly.</p>

<p>I guess now might be a good time to let you know whats been going on the past month or so.</p>

<p>Have spent most of my time in Cardiff trying to get various bits and bobs with our network funtional. </p>

<p>First of all there was a bit of a snag getting our ISP sorted. In a bid to fire a big “up yours” across NTL’s bow and their 1Gb cap, and to make a point to the rest of the student population of Cardiff realise that there isn’t just a single ISP in Cardiff – we decided to get ADSL.</p>

<p>This in turn meant getting a phone line with BT, as the original one had been disconnected as the residents before had been with NTL. We had to sign up for a 3 month minimum contract to get connected again. Sorted. Now for ADSL…..</p>

<p>We’d already figured that Pipex were the ones to go with, weighing in all costs for disconnection when we leave and all. Onto their website to sign up, bung in new BT phone no….boom “You have got ADSL enabled on your exchange, but you are too far to receive it”, uh-oh – and the realisation starts hitting that if we can’t get ADSL, we’re stuffed for at least 3 months, as we need to get the phone line with NTL too….(I spose we could of had two phone lines, but thats a bit much)…</p>

<p>So, what to do……</p>

<p>hang on what this ?? – “Pipex Extended Reach Trial” – Apparently BT have been conducting extended reach trials for ADSL since about June ’03 for those out of reach from their exchange’s. What the hell, give it a go, got no better options….after moping around worrying loads with all 3 of my housemates packing it at the prospect of no broadband for 3 months, finally get conformation from Pipex to say ADSL will be enabled – the very next day! Wohoo!</p>

<p>So we’ve (or I, as we don’t have a router/server for a bit) have happily been using Pipex for the past week, lovely…got it in time to say a Happy 21st Birthday to my sis in Mississippi! and safe in the knowledge that she had received my pukker “Save Ferris” T Shirt I lovingly picked out for her.</p>

<p>So now we await on ebuyer….once again. So that I can build my pc into a new beast (new case, dvd, graphics card and floppy) and sell Sparksy my old one. Then we can use his old 166 as a router over at the girls, and get back Daves old 266 to be the router here (we need USB ports on ours for the modem). On a side note, smoothwall looks to be well easy to set up, except for its compatibility probs with old ISA type network cards as Dave found out last weekend.</p>

<p>It also looks like I’m travelling to Bristol next week to set up another mates network. I will be knackered by the weekend – Adam Freeland, Unkle, Mr Scruff and DJ Format are all playing in Cardiff next week……killer…</p>
