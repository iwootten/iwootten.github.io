      <div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2013</div>

          <p>10 years ago today, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That&#8217;s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that&#8217;s quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 &#8220;weblog tool&#8221;</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>
<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed &#8211; I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently &#8211; which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I&#8217;m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I&#8217;m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it&#8217;s the moments I don&#8217;t share that are most important to me.</p>
<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>

          <p>You pay for your ticket, hotels, travel and then spend the rest of the year excitedly awaiting being able to attend <em>the conference</em> everyone is speaking about. Having travelled halfway across the country, braving weather you&#8217;d never ordinarily leave the house for, you arrive in the unrecognisable city. You&#8217;ve left your family to be here, which is heart wrenching at the best of times and your lonely hotel room is no comfort (especially given the number of beds it has). </p>
<p>You hurredly beaver off to the first fringe event with butterflies in anticipation of the luminaries that are possibly going to be there too. On arrival, the room is bustling with faces from avatars you recognise. How exciting! You know so much about these people from following them day to day; even what they ate for breakfast, the bars they attended, who they hang with.</p>
<p>Yet these cheery personas are only facets of their real life. Chances are, any person you recognise is someone you admire in the industry &#8211; but what could you possibly have to talk about? Your lowly 9-5 pales in comparison to the waves these trendsetters are making, they wouldn&#8217;t really care what you do would they? Maybe we have something in common? Unfortunately, it&#8217;s always far easier to remain silent than waltz up to someone new or that you recognise and drum up a conversation. Inevitably, this more than often happens. </p>
<p>The organisers have done a fantastic job. &#8220;Talk with everyone else, make friends&#8221;, they prompt &#8211; if only you were able to. The conference itself is amazing, inspiring and useful, but others seem to get so much more from it. New friendships are forged, existing ones cemented. Are you the issue here?</p>
<p>Finding food is a problem. Do you venture out in the hope of finding people to talk to, or do you eat out on your own? It becomes easier to ask via twitter, than face to face. At least the conference day provides lunch for you, even if you choose to eat it on your own. You feel like a teenager.</p>
<p>The after-party is much like being back at a school disco. People stare longingly into their empty glasses, whilst propping up walls, longing for company. Why don&#8217;t you talk to them? Others circle back into their longstanding groups and attract fresh blood. Those in groups wear similar clothes. Maybe you should buy plaid? You return to the hotel at a reasonable hour, missing out on the later rawkus highjinks.</p>
<p>In the morning, you skulk back onto your bus, wishing you&#8217;d coughed up the extra to go via train just to get home sooner.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/10/25/discovering-google">Discovering Google</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">25 Oct 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve recently read a post over on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-40-history-arpanet">guardians technology site</a> which gave a whistle-stop history of the internet as it turns 40. I thought I&#8217;d share here my own experiences of growing up alongside the web, more for my own record than anything.</p>
<p>I remember at school a time at which there was no external connection, nor internal network (which we the pupils used) so the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Network_Computer">Acorn machines</a> used at our school at the time could communicate with one another. Computers, for me at that point were standalone. I had as much of an interest in computing then as I do now and I can remember early on, staying around after school to use one of the only PC&#8217;s in the school (which was bought to run a piece of career piece software called Kudos), in order to attempt to run the demo games from cds found on pc mags at the time (the only one I can remember was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104692/">lawnmower man</a> demo). I did this until ofter one time a friend and I accidentally removing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT">autoexec.bat</a> file which I hadn&#8217;t backed up&#8230;..oopsy</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/riscosoldlook-300x225.gif" alt="RiscOS. Old School. Literally. Taken from toastytech.com" title="riscosoldlook" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-350" /></p>
<p>I of course had to stick around at school because we didn&#8217;t have our own pc at home, because they were very, very expensive (When we did finally get one, it was a Crappard Bell 486 DX2 66, 4 MB of RAM, 400MB HD and was over £1000). I felt a little jealous of my friends who both had PC&#8217;s and were able to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta">Microsoft&#8217;s Encarta</a> to help them out with their homework at that time. (Interestingly Encarta later also became a <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/">website</a> and is to be discontinued later this week).</p>
<p>Bizarrely, I&#8217;d opted for A-Levels at 6th Form which didn&#8217;t allow me to experiment with pc&#8217;s much, not that it would have mattered as although the rest of the world was transitioning toward them, the <a href="http://www.gryphon.dorset.sch.uk/">Gryphon school</a> I attended had a whole computing lab full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiscPC">RiscPC</a>&#8216;s. I think I went there once in the two years of A-Levels I did and kept my nose upturned whilst I was there.</p>
<p>Some point over this time, I&#8217;d also got hooked on a magazine called <a href="http://www.pcformat.co.uk/">PC Format</a> since the latter years of school, which allowed me to get all the games demos I wanted without spending however many years (and £&#8217;s) it would have taken to download them all. (I kept all 4 years worth of magazines I&#8217;d bought and cds/dvds right up unto moving in with my wife). At home, even though we were now in the year 1999, my parents hadn&#8217;t yet opted to purchase a dial-up modem and make that leap online. I was of course, still jealous of those mates &#8211; who now were connected. I got myself a hotmail account, where I eagerly awaited emails from no-one.</p>
<p>I can remember going to college and being scared about the prospect of doing a computing course but never having had any prior experience of using the web. My parents finally got a modem that year, but I still used to use the computing labs after teaching. I could download 1MB samples of music from <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk">Juno records</a> much more quickly over the leased line than I ever could waiting on the 56Kbps dialup at home. I also began working at <a href="http://www.dixons.co.uk/">Dixons</a> (for my sins), getting paid a pittance to talk to many clueless customers about &#8220;stereos&#8221;, &#8220;cd players&#8221; and &#8220;N64&#8242;s&#8221;. Working at Dixons did at least afford me the opportunity to experience playing Quake in Yeovils one and only internet cafe on a LAN against my friends and the staff that worked there. </p>
<p>My LAN parties moved to the computing labs at the university, outside of working hours (because as their 10 year old posters claim, you&#8217;re not allowed to use games on them during working hours&#8230;). Over several years of using the web, I&#8217;d never once heard of Google until it was mentioned by one of the research students taking our internet computing lectures. &#8220;You&#8217;ve probably heard of this&#8221; he said. &#8220;Er, no&#8221;, I thought &#8211; why did no-one tell me? I&#8217;d used a number of search engines such as <a href="http://www.lycos.co.uk/">lycos</a> and later <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">webcrawler</a>, but all were pretty awful in terms of giving me what I wanted &#8211; results. Instead they seemed content with a ridiculous number of adverts and making me hunt through a huge number of pages. Their pages now seem to indicate a new direction. </p>
<p>A bit of a trip down memory lane, but that&#8217;s how I ended up being introduced to Google. How about you?</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/01/29/what-do-i-have-to-contribute">What do I have to contribute?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">29 Jan 2009</div>

          <p>It has struck me over the last couple of days and it&#8217;s a reflection of my attitude to being interested in geeky things in general. I&#8217;m an elitist. When I started my blog back in 2003, I loved the fact that relatively few of them existed. It was a reflection of my day to day life and I felt my voice was being heard (even though I had no analytics tools to back that up and it was not particularly interesting).</p>
<p>Back then, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started out</a> on <a href="http://movabletype.com/">Movable Type</a> and quickly moved it over to <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2/cafelog</a>, which later grew into <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. Fast forward 5 years to now and every manner of blog subject exists, whilst in the meantime my own seems to have fallen into a state of disrepair. </p>
<p>I think my blogs&#8217; own slowdown has occurred because blogging about day to day life is not so much fun now &#8211; I&#8217;m no longer unique as I was in terms of the technical ability of being able to output my thoughts. Anyone can start a blog, <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblelog</a>, <a href="http://sweetcron.com">lifestream</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">twitter</a> account and use it to expose their daily activity online. They need to know nothing, or very little at all about how the back end works. So I&#8217;m now left thinking, what do I have to contribute in all this? </p>
<p>My own PhD research has had little exposure here, where if I had chosen to air my thoughts, it might be continuing in new directions from discussion which may have opened up around it. Instead, it is hidden away in research papers and closed forums which an average joe may never come across.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m proposing that I push to air my thoughts on all manner of subject here over the coming year, as well as my usual day-to-day activity. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be contributing something new, something interesting, something playing on my mind and which I want to discuss with each post. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d love it if you&#8217;d join me for the ride and I promise I won&#8217;t be at all elitist.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">20 Dec 2007</div>

          <p>I&#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&#8217;ll be rewarded. It&#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the <a href="http://www.xen10.com">small hosting company</a> that I&#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.</p>
<p>Today, one of my favourite breaks record labels (Marine Parade) were offering a compo to win a cd by responding to them over myspace. (Ok, maybe a somewhat less grandiose scenario than this post may have made out, but still!) I&#8217;ve long refused to sign up to myspace out of principles (it looks bloody awful, mainly) so I sent them a message to point it out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to respond to get the cd via myspace, I feel I shouldn&#8217;t have to be forced to use that poor excuse for an interweb page.</p>
<p>Anyway, here is my address just in case you feel like sending me Adam Freelands &#8211; Tectonics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To my joy, they didn&#8217;t care!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fair enough, you get one!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever won a competition due to principles. Maybe I should start bending the rules of other competitions and still try to win prizes?</p>
