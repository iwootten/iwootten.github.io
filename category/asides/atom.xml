		   <p>I’m not sure how many visitors have caught this ted talk before, but I’d thought I’d post it anyway. Johnny Chung Lee is amazing, turning a $40 wii remote into use an interactive whiteboard or a new way to interact with video games via head tracking. He’s been at this sort of thing for ages previously putting out a <a href="http://www.littlegreatideas.com/steadycam/">$14 steadycam</a>.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[
		   <p>Today on the return from uni I passed the new Subway that is opening up soon near Queen Street train station. On one of their job adverts, they were advertising for team leaders and <em>sandwich artists</em>. I’ve never really noticed my sandwiches being arranged in a artistic fashion before, maybe it would brighten my day if they were. I feel sorry for the poor art school graduate who ends up filling baguettes for a living.</p>

<p>Does anyone else have examples of jobs with somewhat over enthusiastic job titles?</p>

		   <p>pMachine has changed its name to <a href="http://ellislab.com">Ellislab</a>, and are <a href="http://ellislab.com">sporting a shiny new website for all to see</a>. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don’t fall under the same banner now. I’m glad to see that the <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> website has got a facelift. <a href="http://31three.com/">31three</a> did the hard graft on the design and <a href="http://ellislab.com">they</a> all <a href="http://expressionengine.com">look</a> <a href="http://codeigniter.com">awesome</a>.</p>

		   <p>I found a wicked animation by Maria Claudia Cortes describing what personalities a bunch of colours are often attributed with. I reckon I’m a mixture of red and blue, my wardrobe reflects this as well. <a href="http://www.mariaclaudiacortes.com/">What colour are you?</a></p>
