	<p>Yesterday I got a little annoyed about the fact that it seemed as if <a href="http://play.com">play</a> had forgotten all details of my existence and telling me my email address was wrong. After sending a little letter off to them complaining yesterday evening, I realised after their response that actually I’d altered my saved email a little while before. I went ahead and placed my order of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/">Sideways</a> this morning which I’d expected to be fairly good due to the rave reviews I’d heard of it.</p>

<p>Going to the Matthias’ for tea revealed that they had also made the purchase, so we decided to watch it this evening. Oh dear, oh dear. I can’t say this was my most favourite film ever and has to rank up there with “Being John Malkovich” for dodgy purchases of mine. It would have been ok if only I had returned now and been able to cancel my order, but I’ve already recieved the mail for dispatch…..</p>

<div class="author_meta">23 Jul 2006</div>
	<p>From “How To Succeed With Women Without Really Trying” c1957</p>

<p>“The first wife, as opposed to the fiancee, must be practicable and serviceable. She is neither a toy, an ornament, nor a playmate. She will be your wife during the early, hard years before you can afford a staff of servants. She will serve as mother, cook, housemaid, chauffeur, nurse, and charwoman. This will allow her, if she is nimble, six or seven hours of sleep a night, ample for a sturdy girl.</p>

<p>It is best, before deciding definitely, to test for firmness. Few of us would consider buying a grapefruit before squeezing it-yet how many make the far more important choice of close companion in a sloppy, hit-or-miss fashion?</p>

<p>Using the thumb and forefinger, exert gentle pressure along certain key muscles. A girl with good muscular tone will wear well and last for years, even if neglected occasionally. She will not tire easily, and will usually maintain a cheerful disposition despite long hours and hard work.</p>

<p>‘Davie, you pinched me!’<br />
‘Oh, sorry, Pheobe. Must have slipped.’<br />
‘Well stop!’<br />
‘Have you ever thought of taking a bit more exercise?’ “</p>

<div class="author_meta">22 May 2006</div>
	<p>So I managed to make it to the zoo yesterday, which was very exciting. More exciting though, was the night safari, where everything is minimally lit with the animals there to give a night time experience (I expect). I was a bit worried about catching buses and the like, but it was fine in the end, everything was really very well laid out, it was a doddle.</p>

<p>Today I’m off to visit the somewhat artificial Sentosa island – there seems to be a bit of controversy about the fact the land is all ‘reclaimed’.</p>

<p>Anyway, just a short blog (I’m being timed) to let you know whats going down in Singapore.</p>

<p>Catch up with you all later,</p>

<p>Ian</p>

	<h1><a href="/2006/05/19/singapore-day-3">Singapore Day 3</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">19 May 2006</div>
	<p>I’ve just returned from the conference dinner to finalise CCGRID for ’06. Tomorrow will be its last day whereupon everyone will return to their various different countries, or maybe somewhere closer for a short time on holiday. I’ve already heard of others plans to see Malaysia and Vietnam. I’ll be here until Tuesday evening to check out all that Singapore has to offer (at least I hope I will be able to).</p>

<p>Tonight’s meal was very crazy, lots of food that I wouldn’t normally eat, but I seemed to manage all 8 courses without too much trouble. Shark soup, chickens with their heads still on and lots of beer and tea were all on the menu. There was also some crazy dancing which went on between about course 6/7.</p>

<p>I’m getting a little more used to the layout of everything so far in the university, but it’s so spread out and the buildings are so similar it’s still pretty confusing. </p>

<p>I’ll get to explore the use of the MRT more than previously from tomorrow, and to explore some slightly more diverse areas I guess, with much photo taking. This includes the now infamous Orchard Road everyone has been talking about, as I have been unable to reach it previously, hopefully a few cheapo gadgets may catch my eye. I’d also like to go to the night zoo, but this is a bit awkward as it runs late at night and the last bus connection to it is fairly early in comparison in the evening. Annoying. Today is also my last day with definite internet access, so I may not post any updates until when I return afterwards. Sorry about that, especially if you’re anyone who may be even missing me.</p>

<div class="author_meta">17 May 2006</div>
	<p>So, I have arrived safe and sound in Singapore. I got in yesterday and have been doing various CCGrid related things since. Yesterday evening, after a quick shower I headed off to find the conference venue and something to eat. Unfortunately I spent the best part of my time wondering round trying to find the venue! It was rather annoying as a large majority of pedestrian routes had been obstructed due to a huge amount of road works going on around the university premises. After asking a few people for directions I figured out where I was and have now discovered an altogether much simpler route to the university when I was able to go there in the light. The layout of the buildings is still very confusing though. I did get to see lots of Singapore at night though, so that was quite exciting and a random (what sounded Christian) rock group performing and lots of uni groups practicing playing drums and things.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning is when my presentation is going on, so I’ve been preparing this evening for it. My hotel is nice enough, although it might have been an idea for me to have chosen somewhere slightly closer to the university, its still less than what I’d have to walk in Cardiff to uni though. I meandered over to the food court across the way from where I’m staying this evening, with I think some strange looks from the kitchen staff, though I couldn’t figure out what they were indicating. The television in the hotel is a real hotch-botch of all manner of different channels, some English, some Chinese, and the English channels are all a dire mix of old cheesy films and very bad comedy. The internet access in the hotel is also really expensive, I doubt I’ll be using it that much, so forgive me if my updates are a little less frequent than previously, I’ll have access at the conference until Friday, unless I can find somewhere else.</p>

<p>I think I’m finding this experience altogether a bit more difficult to shift to than Chicago, basically because I know I stick out a bit here and can’t speak the lingo. Hopefully things will become a bit easier soon enough.</p>

<div class="author_meta">15 May 2006</div>
	<p>So despite having only been back in the UK for less than a week, I’m now off to Singapore, to present another paper of my work at CCGrid06. I’m slightly less nervewracked this time, but not looking forward to the ridiculous flight time (best part of 13 hours) and the time difference when I arrive (+ 7 hours). Viv tells me its a beautiful and amazingly techie place, so it sounds not at all distant from my own bedroom.</p>

<p>I’ll try and post more as and when I have interesting stuff to report!</p>

<div class="author_meta">06 May 2006</div>
	<p>So today marks the last day I’m put up in the Hard Rock, and my last full day here in the states. I awoke to a bill that had been slipped under my door to announce that I’d been charged for their “intimacy kit”, because I had moved it to have a look at it, and this constitutes a charge. I found this most amusing. I think I’ll make sure that there are no more automated charges made before I leave, seeing as how I’ve actually used nothing….</p>

<p>Anyway, tonight I am hopefully off to see the mighty <a href="http://djatrak.com/">A-Trak</a> at the Empty Bottle here in Chicago. It should be fairly awesome I’ll let you know what happens later, if I can ever reach the place.</p>

<div class="author_meta">06 May 2006</div>
	<p>After the workshop ended in the early hours of the afternoon today, I thought it would be kinda cool to head over and see if I could find threadless in Chicago, to stock up on some more of their awesome t shirts. After a little bit of thinking and umming and ahh-ing about whether or not I could actually find the place, I decided to make a a go of it and try.</p>

<p>A short train ride later, I found the offices of skinnycorp, and got shown round the whole setup, introduced to peeps and given some of those oh so amusing “i park like an idiot” stickers. It was kinda surreal to see all these people whole acted as models on the website in real life. Charlie showed me around the place..you can lots of vids of the guy (bearded, glasses, boxed) over at <a href="http://www.craigshimala.com">Craig Shimala’s</a> web site.</p>

<p>I also got the experience of going to see the whitesox today…even though they scored 3 home runs, they didn’t win, but the fireworks at the end were amazing! You can see me, Steve and Paul over on the <a href="http://www.printroom.com/ViewGalleryPhoto.asp?userid=wsfanfoto&#038;gallery_id=377846&#038;image_id=27">sox site</a>.</p>

<div class="author_meta">05 May 2006</div>
	<p>Hello. Today marked the second day in the workshop I’m attending and the presentation of some of my own work and thoughts. I’ve also experienced some very useful thoughts of not only my work, but my PhD as a whole. Today is a good day for that. </p>

<p>Yesterday evening we attended an italian restaurant as part of the evening meals for the conference, which featured such a ridulous amount of food it was stupid. We had less people on our table, and it meant that actually we would end up with more than a dish each – 1 1/2 plates each full to the brim. Twas nice…</p>

<p>I also managed to finally get to experience Chicago Downtown pizza, which is something which has to be done apparently. Prior to this also, I managed to get an experience of drinking in a bar looking atop one of the smaller buildings in the area. Have a look at the pic for an idea of what it looked like.</p>

Here’s some views of my hotel room looking out onto Sears, complete with the only person whom is here with me. I have to head out now, for the conference dinner etc. I shall be sure to post later.</p>
