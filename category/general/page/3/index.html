          <p>Digg.com is sporting the ability to be able to now rate online video and podcasts. Postcast searching is in limited beta for registered users only.I just spent a while perusing some items of interest, and found a great segment of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8169033819829939284&#038;hl=en">play</a>! over on google. This just builds on the fact that Mario has the most awesome music ever.The searching of podcasts is dangerously close to an idea I&#8217;ve currently working on myself for a while now. Maybe I should get on with it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Nov 2006</div>

          <p>The amazing Zach Braff has made an appearance over at <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/657/Some_Choices_Are_Just_Out_of_Reach">threadless</a> to show off the t-shirt which was designed to promote his new film, &#8220;The Last Kiss&#8221;. Apparently according to the <a href="http://www.threadless.com/loves/thelastkiss">audio interview</a> he gave, he also was going to try to wear it on scrubs at some point, with a cheeky reference to the film. It&#8217;s also featuring as part of their current $10 sale in the run up to christmas. I myself have purchased 3 more to add to my collection. Although its nice, Zach&#8217;s design wasn&#8217;t one of them.<center>

</center>*Looking at the image a bit closer, it looks as if this indeed might be the Scrubs set.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 Oct 2006</div>

          <p>Does anyone else get the distinct impression that halloween is reserved for lamers? I mean, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, it stems from a pagan festival celebrating a time at which spirits can make contact with the physical world. Is that something people really want to be celebrating? </p>
<p>I assume that the majority of the world goes along with the fact its just a bit of fun, a time at which kids get dressed up and collect sweets door-to-door, punishing those who don&#8217;t pay up with a bombing of baking compnents and parents play the niave fools. It&#8217;s a bit strange that people are so wound up with partying they don&#8217;t even know why they&#8217;re doing it. The same goes for Christmas and Easter too.</p>

          <p>Somebody should really remind me the evening before the clocks go back. I got up at 7.30 today and could have done with that extra hours lie-in. Oh well!</p>
