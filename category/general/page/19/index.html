          <p>Seeing as how I haven&#8217;t posted anything here properly for far too long, I thought I&#8217;d give an update on everything I&#8217;ve been doing since we last spoke..</p>
<p>Firstly, I got my degree, with the grades I wanted, although not perhaps in the subjects I expected to get them in, though I guess thats always the way. As a result of that, I&#8217;m going to be staying on at Cardiff for a PhD conducting research into the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="Provenance Aware Service Oriented Architecture">PASOA</a> project over the coming year. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m fully aware of what this is going to entail either academically or in terms of life the universe and everything. However I figure its best to attack this at this stage of my life when I&#8217;ve got no ties, rather than forever regretting it..</p>
<p>When asking for references for my PhD, I sent off a letter to my old place of work <a href="http://www.aeroint.com" title="My old employer">Aerosystems Intenational</a>, where I carried out a placement year upon the support team. On completing my exams and preparing to head off home for a visit to the parents, I recieved a call asking if I&#8217;d like to return for the summer.. I accepted, started the following week and hence have been tied up with that for the last 2 months! It&#8217;s been really strange being back there, after being away and all, the teams grown a bit and is constantly pulling in contractors to help out. I enjoyed my time back there however, they&#8217;re all very friendly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve discovered a sweet little button in w.bloggar which pulls in my current track from winamp &#8211; very cool <div class="media">

          <p>Hmm, haven&#8217;t really written much here in a while. Things are going ok, I have my final 4 exams over the next fortnight which I&#8217;m currently struggling revising for. Will hopefully pull out the grades I want, but I&#8217;m cutting it fine..</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also finished my project, and its up and running on the web at <a href="http://www.understroke.com" title="My final year project">www.understroke.com</a> (requires client side XSL processing, IE 6+ Mozilla 1.4+).</p>
<p>Anyway, thats all I have to say for now, I&#8217;m off to watch Kill Bill 2..</p>

          <p>Hurrah, exams over for another few months. I&#8217;m glad, and completely exhausted by them all. I was feeling completely overrun by them all. Still now its time to kick back and relax&#8230;until er &#8211; Monday</p>

          <p>Having just installed the latest version of wordpress over b2 (thus ruining said previous mood plugin) I now have a working image upload abilities! Just to give you an idea of what goes on up in Cardiff, have a look at this pic of me and my long lost brother.</p>

          <p>Allow me to breathe a sigh of relief&#8230;I&#8217;ve just spent most of the last hour sorting out what&#8217;s rubbish from most of the paper lying about my room, whilst searching for my student support details. I did find them, could of been a messy first few weeks back at Uni if I hadn&#8217;t!</p>
<p>I also found a mates wedding invitation and list, reminding me that I actually have to reply to say that I&#8217;m attending, and buy them a present. All the gifts on the wedding lists are well boring though, just bedlinen, jars and other stuff. Very uninspiring.</p>
