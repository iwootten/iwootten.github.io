      <div class="author_meta">29 Nov 2005</div>

          <p>I spent the weekend back at home in recognition of my parents 30th wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s quite bizarre looking through their wedding photos (I&#8217;d never seen them before) and picking out all my relatives in mini form. Said previous ladyfriend decided she&#8217;d brave the border as well to make those &#8220;all important&#8221; first introductions. She might of thought better of it if she knew parentals were going to bring their saturday night party back to ours and keep everyone awake until the early hours.</p>
<p>I got to see all my fabulous pals as well as witness the dedication of Jase and Stephs daughter Eden at the service on Sunday with lots of fireworks type &#8220;ooh&#8217;s and ahh&#8217;s&#8221; from the elderly members to express her cuteness. As a gesture of thanks, the Helyars bought everyone there a doughnut, putting my previous contributions to Vineyard somewhat to shame.</p>
<p>After a detour to clarks village with Paul tagging along (after a number of bump starts &#8211; remember to keep the keys in the ignition mate), we made it back to Cardiff and headed off to see the amazing Prodigy. I was so tired by now it was ridiculous, I used to remember home as a quiet place, it didn&#8217;t seem to be the case this visit but still somehow managed to roll up at the CIA. The warm up act (Audio Bully&#8217;s) really sucked big time, and it was quite amusing to hear the roar as the first track from the dj&#8217;s came on afterwards. Anyway, after feeling suitably psyched, Paul, I and the large group in the bit that formed around us spent the next 2 hours going mental to all the classics, without a black eye in sight. Lot&#8217;s of fond childhood memories came flooding back of music sharing in Pauls living room. Twas brill it twas.</p>

          <p>I think I&#8217;m a little less than perceptive of situations in which I&#8217;m involved. Recently, I&#8217;ve been clued in to a number of things which makes me think I&#8217;ve been carrying freeriding on this life while I could of been part of something so much more interesting. This isn&#8217;t a direct attack on anyone but myself, so don&#8217;t anyone take it to heart. I think this is best shown through the forming of a type of relationship I&#8217;ve been starved of for the best part of my life, one with my lovely new girlfriend.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve discovered &#8220;the best&#8221; electronic album I&#8217;ve heard in goodness knows how long, once again confirming my above suspicions. <a href="http://www.boomkat.com/item.cfm?id=10674">&#8220;Ulrich Schnauss &#8211; A Strangely Isolated Place&#8221;</a> is currently making my spare time bliss though the tracklisting could lead you to believe the contrary and summises where I&#8217;ve been for a while. I advise anyone with a pulse and a desire to feel uplifted to contemplate the benefits of purchase. For all the others (without a pulse or a desire not to be uplifted), theres some free tracks on his <a href="http://www.ulrich-schnauss.com/">website</a>.</p>

          <p>Some of the thoughts in <a href="http://www.beingbarbara.com/?p=290">this post</a> over at Barbara&#8217;s really hit home with me today. I don&#8217;t often take time to reflect on pointers like these but the majority of them are ringing alarm bells about some aspect of my life at the moment.</p>

          <p>From a sample upon the <a href="http://www.solidsteel.org/moneyshot/DJ_Moneyshot_-_Dischandler.mp3">dischandler</a> (DJ Moneyshot):</p>
<p>&#8220;No one wants to be a failure, no one wants a life constantly filled with worry, fear and frustration. Therefore you must remember to reap that which you sow. If you sow negative thoughts, your life will be filled with negative things. If you sow positive thoughts, your life will be cheerful, successful and positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so sure how this pads out in real life&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;m feeling rather fragile at the moment, which is really annoying because the majority of the time I&#8217;m the picture of health. It started yesterday, but I thought I&#8217;d got over it only for headaches and tummy aches to return by the evening. Unfortunately, it meant I wasn&#8217;t best of hosts to Hannah who stayed over on Sunday because of a stereophonics gig she was going to. I had to fix her up with Jon to go with as her mate decided to back out on her pretty late. Hannah got a few odd looks at the prospect of her taking her inflatable guitar though.. </p>
<p>Todays been enrolment, which is just a pain as well due to central being at talybont and departmental being down in Queens. I think I must have been quite out of it as I just randomly decided to queue with people in trevithick, until realising that actually my enrolment was in a completely different building and had been every year I&#8217;d been there.</p>
<p>Theres noticeably more students around here and less parking spaces. So much so as some old welsh coot decided to give me verbal for no apparent reason outside my house. I won&#8217;t describe in detail what happened but suffice to say he was obviously mad. Anyways, I guess there&#8217;ll be more of that in the pipeline over the coming year&#8230;</p>
