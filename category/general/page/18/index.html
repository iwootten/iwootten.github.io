          <p>So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life&#8230;boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John&#8217;s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.</p>
<p>I had a wicked time over New Years with the Southampton/Cardiff posse in Beddgelert, climbing Snowdon and enduring other peoples (mostly Stephen&#8217;s) sleeping habits. New Years Eve was especially great due to the copius amounts of party items that were flung our way by the local&#8217;s landlord. Check out the images here:  </p>

    I&#8217;m playing my first gig tonight, over at BSB with the <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com" title="Off The Shelf website">&#8220;Off The Shelf&#8221;</a> guys, so am especially nervous at the mo. Luckily, it&#8217;s billed as a birthday party for Waldron so hopefully there&#8217;ll be a bit of a different atmosphere than normal.

          <p>Can it be December already? What have I been doing? Wheres the last 3 months gone? I have to say I feel more Christmas-sy this year in Cardiff than I have ever been up here. </p>
<p>There seems to have been a bit of a build up so far.. Watching &#8220;Bad Santa&#8221; back in Nov (quite possibly the most amount of swearing I&#8217;ve ever seen in a film), going to Germany the other week with all the festive fun over there. Now a flurry of meals and events in Cardiff before shipping back to Somerset and seeing all me ol&#8217; muckers back there&#8230;man the other 3 years spent here seem well depressing compared to this! Not that actually there&#8217;s really that much going on now..</p>
<p>I expect they&#8217;ll be a number of pics showing events up here at some point, be sure to keep tabs on the gallery.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Nov 2004</div>

          <p>Thought I&#8217;d have a moan about a few bits and bobs&#8230;same old, same old</p>
<p>I had a bit of an interesting experience today when my speedo decided to die halfway to Rhwibina. Could have been worse I guess, could of been on the motorway. Anyway, best get that sorted.</p>
<p>Uni seems to be going ok, the works piling up a bit though. It&#8217;s a bit of a nightmare to think about teaching and researching within the same day, takes me ages to adjust and concentrate for that matter. Had a meeting with the other half of the research team in Southampton, so that got me up to speed on a lot of things.</p>
<p>I need to get some djing on the cards, but I&#8217;m too whimpish to go ahead and do it. Fear of rejection see. I&#8217;m doing nothing in the evenings, which is pretty awful, especially when it gets through to Friday night. Nov 5th brought it home a bit. I&#8217;m glad theres loads of other PhD&#8217;s about, at least I get a few things done with them, never really had that sort of interaction outside of uni hours with other people on my course as an undergrad.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been to so many of my close mates wedding over the last couple of years&#8230; In fact I don&#8217;t actually think any of the old school crew are still single! Anyway in celebration of this, and Pauls recent marriage to Lisa, I&#8217;ve shoved up a gallery to show off some of the pics I have for them.</p>
<p>The gallery is located <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Wootten/gallery/">here</a>, and for the blog here&#8217;s Paul in his new found role:</p>
