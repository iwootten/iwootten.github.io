          <p>There&#8217;s loads of places on the net where you can view silly or stupid signs. Most of the ones I&#8217;ve seen aren&#8217;t from the UK though, and I can&#8217;t imagine them any kind of scenario, which I think would make them all the more funny. This place has loads, so many I can&#8217;t afford to look through all of them. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve missed it before.</p>

          <p>If I had something interesting to say I would say it, but I don&#8217;t really so instead I&#8217;ll hit you with a few ebay bargains I&#8217;ve picked up of late. Currently I&#8217;m holding a rating of 166 positive, I reckon thats pretty good. Anybody else bought anything interesting off the net lately?</p>

I started this after getting annoyed with reading huge mundane chunks of history in 1984. Loads of this is so close to the truth its scary, I&#8217;ve carried stupidly heavy things across Cardiff for instance, more than once actually, just to save a quid or so.

          <p>Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday. Me being a little bit more independant of late, thought sod it and went by myself, getting bought drinks by Phantom Beats (the guy I went to see) while I was there&#8230;nice.</p>
<p>I just returned from my actual birthday here at home, bowling&#8230;..exciting stuff! Ah well, once again not that many people about, with a distinct lack of things available to do in our small town in Somerset. The cream on the cake is I just discovered on returning, I share my birthday with a great comedian &#8211; namely <a href="http://frostitution.net/" title="Fanpage">Nick Frost</a>, star of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead fame. Rock on!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Mar 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;m trying to decide what to do for my birthday which falls on Bank holiday monday this year. Currently I&#8217;m of the mind to do something on Good Friday like have a meal, then off to town (Chico Fresco and Phantom Beats will be at bsb apparently)&#8230;.Leaving me free to go back and have easter and my actual birthday with family and friends. I&#8217;m going to be 24&#8230;<em>24</em>,<strong>24?!</strong>, no surely thats not right! I still feel about 18 and all my years as an undergrad never happened, I certainly don&#8217;t <em>act</em> my age. Ah well, I&#8217;ll get over it..It&#8217;s not actually that big a deal. I&#8217;ll have to anyway, it&#8217;ll happen again next year. If anyones about in cardiff then and wants to help me celebrate, please let me know!</p>
<p>I had my first quote immortalised upon our quote board at home, I&#8217;m usually quite careful not to say anything stupid with housemates about, thats Tim&#8217;s job, but this was due to a recent trip to the bay. I was talking to Cath Evans about my last trip to the bay (on my 20th birthday co-incidentally), where upon we were set upon by a load of kids off of the estate who decided to throw rocks at us whilst waiting for the train. Anyway it reads <em>&#8220;This is my first trip to the bay since we got stoned on my birthday.&#8221;</em> I think a lot of people on the train got an unintended impression of me after that conversation.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">21 Feb 2005</div>

          <p>My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It&#8217;s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.</p>
<p>This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis&#8217;s in Swansea for a bit to say hi. We spent the afternoon shopping at Tesco&#8217;s and choosing each other&#8217;s various toiletry related items! Great chance to see where she&#8217;s been living (pretty much across the road from where she did previously), hang out and watch trashy tv with one another (Go Chunk).</p>
<p>I spent monday over at Viv&#8217;s &#8220;Chocolate Evening&#8221; with her and Zoe watching Dodgeball, which was a laugh a minute&#8230; I think I&#8217;d been on a bit of a downer that day and thats just what I needed. I think it might of been a slight overkill on the chocolate though.</p>
<p>Thursday was of course my first appearance under my dj pseudonym &#8220;Scrumpy Jack&#8221; (keeping it real &#8211; from my roots of Somerset), I was a bit unimpressed by my performance, no matter what mates say, but it was cool to play in the Welsh club &#8211; what a &#8220;proper&#8221; club should be. This kind of inspired me to knock out a mix (one of the longest I&#8217;ve done in a while) on Saturday afternoon. I might shove it somewhere on the web if I can find a suitable place. Dodgy in places, but I don&#8217;t really care as I hadn&#8217;t prepared at all for it.</p>
<p>Checked out the &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; guys on Friday night &#8211; some mad jungle biznis till late into the night. Yesterday evening involved building a large fire on the beach and some random plank walking over it by peeps. Very nice evening, moonlit beach all to ourselves, extremely cool. The highlight of the evening had to be Carl and Meilyr running away from a random welsh guys car after checking that he hadn&#8217;t rigged up some sophisticated suicide routine while we&#8217;d been in the pub, and had actually just fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Next week I&#8217;m off to see the parentals in Yeovil, which is nice&#8230;..</p>
