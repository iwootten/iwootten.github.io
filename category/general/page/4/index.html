          <p>Hi there, we&#8217;ve not spoken in a while. How&#8217;s you?It seems I&#8217;ve been succumbing to a lifestyle of late that I wish I would never end up at &#8211; that of working within a &#8220;routine&#8221;. I must be getting old. The whole of last week seemed a little bit of a drain, working my ass off trying to get tiny parts of code to work properly in the day and the rest of the time being tired that I was staying up late to give myself alone time in the evenings. The day and evening seem to blur to become a big mess when I&#8217;m working hard, I lose all concept of what should really be important to me and where my efforts should really be put.Anyway, I&#8217;ve been up to lots other than working, went off to greenbelt last week, which was unexpectedly cool (especially the Ukelele Orchestra!) and spent this weekend with very little time spare once it had all been used up with meeting people, socialising and whatnot. Oh deary me, whats going on? Do I finally have a life?</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to create a site which attracts lot of attention for ages. Not to create some profit-making venture, just to know that my voice was being listened too elsewhere and hopefully appreciated. I suppose that goes for my PhD too. It&#8217;s kind of depressing however that almost everything ever has been done, and every avenue seems blocked in both respects. How do you contribute to a world that is uninsterested in what you have to say? Being a man of high moral standards (!) I don&#8217;t ditch them and say what I think people want to hear, I suffer at their hands silently instead.</p>

          <p>You&#8217;d think that thieves would be content who&#8217;d bent my door back along to try and nick my car, realising actually I have nothing of value. Or that by monitoring my movements over a period of time, the opportune time to get into it would be when I went away to Dublin, Chicago or Singapore for weeks on end. Apparently not, in fact, they think its such a prime example of Vauxhalls lack of security that they would in fact like to come back and try to nick it by bending out the other door right when I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m half tempted to leave a note saying &#8220;theres nothing of value in here, honest&#8221; but I fear it would make it all the more amusing to the little wotsits.</p>
<p>Nothing taken except my self esteem from the last week unfortunately. That and the badge of a &pound;60k Merc near the rec.</p>
