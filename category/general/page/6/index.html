	<p>That last post aside heres a mildly amusing anecdote that happened to me whilst in B&#038;Q a couple of weeks ago featuring a sweet old welsh lady.</p>

<p>Old Lady (Looking at lampshades): “Is that the ACTUAL price of these!?”<br />
Me (Bewildered, wondering past end of aisle): “Well, yeah, it says so on the label”<br />
Old Lady: “£11.99! I saw ‘em for £1 on Newport Road!”<br />
Me (Still bewildered, now in aisle): “Oh. Right. Ok…”<br />
Old Lady: “I’m gonna have to go all the way back down there now..”<br />
Me: “Hmmm…”<br />
Old Lady: “Are you sure these are the only ones you’ve got?!”<br />
Me (Clued in now): “Er, yeah, I don’t actually work here.”<br />
Old Lady: “Oh I’m sorry love (now embarrased to look me in the eye, me backing away), its because you’ve got a black shirt on.”</p>

<p>Well, wearing “a black shirt” is certainly the least amount of requirements I’ve had for any job. It might have been hilarious to just continue the appalling customer service and hand in one of (my co-)workers names as my own when she asked for it…</p>

	<h1><a href="/2005/08/25/bizarre-dreams">Bizarre Dreams</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">25 Aug 2005</div>
	<p>I’ve been having some really random dreams this week, the strangest part being I can actually remember them. Here’s a few examples:</p>

<p>Sunday – I had one of those ones where, you’re aware you’re asleep and can control whats going on, but was face down on my bed and completely overcome by something and unable to move any part of my body. When I woke up, with a bit of a start, I’d only been out for a half hour.</p>

<p>Monday – I dreamt I was down the beach somewhere in Cornwall, an absolutely beautiful place it was, when a huge tidal wave comes crashing in. Everyone legs it, leaving all their belongings. In the aftermath, I return searching through all the debri, which contains a high volume of digital cameras. I’m unable to recover my own, and am instead just left with the case.</p>

<p>Tuesday – In this dream I seem to be visiting the cinema where, for some reason, they’re selling hugely discounted bags of popcorn (£100 -&gt; £0.75!). They are massive bags and although really rather tempted by them, I decide to pass as I don’t think I’ll be able to share the immense amount of popcorn they contain with anyone before it begins to taste stale.</p>

<p>Like I said, pretty bizarre.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2005/08/19/trials-unicycling">Trials Unicycling</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">19 Aug 2005</div>
	<p>I was inspired yesterday by watching a few vids on the internet of <a href="http://www.unicyclejester.com/video.php">crazy kids</a> doing trials unicycling, so decided to go out for a ride in the evening round Roath Park. It’s been a long time since I’ve ridden, but it seems you don’t forget. Nor do the ‘oh I’m original’ taunts cease, such as “oi, mate, you’ve lost a wheel!”, “pull a wheelie!” etc etc. Anyway, it was nice to finally ride mine without fear of the horrid scratching which I usually obtain from my previous saddle. Alas I think it’ll be a long time before I’m able to perform smooth grinds along benches and the like.</p>

<p>Apparently, I’ve heard in Japan where unicycling was invented, trials unicycling is as popular a sport as mountain biking, but I don’t believe this for a minute as I’ve never seen any evidence. I was also wondering what the policy on unicycling upon pavements was…people don’t seem to mind, seem more bemused than anything and move out of the way. </p>

<p>If anyones interested, they can have a <a href="http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mepgjdf/ftt/day1.html">look</a> at the Land’s End to John O’Groats record that my mates broke, 5 years ago. I believe today would be the anniversary of Jay wrecking his van.</p>

<div class="author_meta">17 Aug 2005</div>
	<p>I went back home this weekend for <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Wootten/gallery/folder/Weddings/Tim%20n%20Becca%20-%202005-08-13" title="Pic's">Tim and Becca’s</a> wedding. Although the weather didn’t hold out – it was raining all day, the guys made the most of it and the service was fab. Music was provided by Mr Maynard and a string quartet. By far the most amusing thing was the pastor’s inability to use a radio mike without whispering the whole service. So amusing sentences like “Don’t fall down the steps….like you did yesterday” abounded. </p>

<p>The evening ceremonies – a barn dance and a whole ice-cream cabinet full of sweet’s (which I duely explored without instruction – insighting a bit of a riot!), were held at the Haynes motor museum, which I don’t think I’ve ever been too despite it being upon my doorstep. This was quite cool as it gave us something intersting to look at whilst wondering about. One of the cadillilacs was almost the exact same model I won (though a year older). If it had been the same car I think I would’ve been a tad annoyed as we offered it to them when I won it. Anyway, it was great to catch up with everyone, old faces (my old neighbours!) and see the Yeovil crew.</p>

<p>The weather improved loads the following day – so I made the most of it and drove out to ham hill. It’s changed loads since I went out there last so was a bit confused to find the quarry somewhere else to where it used to be. Anyway, I stayed out there as the sun set and took a couple of pictures. It’s a really beautiful place as you can no doubt see, and holds many fond childhood memories.</p>

	<p>I went to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night – which I thought was great, compared to the original preconceptions I had of it from trailers, reviews and the like. Anyways, I was sat there at the end as all the children were walking out of the factory thinking, “Well, at least I’m not as thin as Mike TV”.</p>

	<p>So, after renewing my insurance policy today, I get handed the piece of paper with my policy number and the words “Ashley, love”. I’m unsure whether the guy wrote this in awe of myself or indeed it had been written previously on the pad in use. Either way, the words in that order don’t make any sense. Dyslexia perhaps? There’s been a bit of talk and reading recently involving dating with integrity, not settling with second best and the like, but this ranks a few rungs below that upon my ladder unfortunately.</p>

	<p>On a lighter note, I went to a ‘focus group’ last night which was fairly surreal. I’d been asked last week to attend, and had agreed not actually knowing the subject matter. On sunday I was informed that it was going to be on ‘mens cosmetics’ (something I’m obviously very familiar with!) so didn’t really know what to expect. After arriving, discovering two of my old coursemates were there (and on the same course as Garima), we sat down for like 45 minutes talking about our opinions about luxuries, cosmetics and as many tangents we could stray off on as possible. It was all fairly amusing, except for the part where I was forced to admit to moisturising in front of a bunch of guys I’d just met…(I get really dry skin!)..</p>

<p>What it did leave me thinking was the whole aspect of image and how we can become overly concerned with it. Most of you who know me know that I’m not overly bothered with combo’s of clothing, I tend to buy on the off chance and whatever is suitable and cheapest. What I am a little more concerned about is my build, but only because people generally comment to me in disdain due to how thin I am. For all those people, I’m really sorry that you seem to have a problem with this, feeling the need to bring it up all the time. I am what I am, God made me this way, I can’t help high metabolism, its not my fault, leave it out!…..really I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be blessed with such a skinny, lanky, body – I’ve had health problems in the past because of it and not the eating disorder kind either. I could understand desire for the tall, dark, handsome, intelligent, humourous, modest angle, but not the lankiness..</p>

<p>Hmm, tangents again, so much for the ‘lighter note’.</p>

	<p>So, in the absence of students, life continues as normal for the various research teams down here in the Queens buildings. We wake, march to University and sit in our little boxes reading, theorising and tearing our hair out until 5 o’clock when we march back, only to be repeated the next day. I hate routines…</p>

<p>Today marked the graduation of Year 3′s which brought back memories of my graduation last year, which was pretty depressing to be honest. It allows me to reflect how far I’ve come in the last year or so and how I’ve not nearly amounted to that image I’d be content with at the beginning of my degree and how perhaps my values have changed. It also made me to look at how much older I am than the vast majority of my colleagues and how different life would have been coming to uni a year earlier. I know the whole experience of that extra couple of years at home was beneficial to me and I was placed there for a reason, but it doesn’t half make me feel inadequate against some of my current pool of mates. This combined with the current lack of air conditioning in our lab and mini-heatwave (we reached 33 degrees) doesn’t make it easy to keep to any train of thought for extended periods.</p>

<p>It makes me wonder where I’ll be in the next year….</p>

<p>Oh – I know! ……. right here sat at my desk</p>

<div class="author_meta">07 Jul 2005</div>
	<p>It’s been a good week thus far. Saturday marked a return to Somerset to attend Steve and Hannah’s wedding, which I was a little late for due to having to pick up a number of interesting things I’ve been given by Gran. I felt a little harsh having to dash in, collect and leave, it felt a little like Dad and I were looting the place.</p>

<p>Being late was ok as one of the speakers was following in just after me (apparently a bit of a search was going on for him prior to the service), confirming we were good to creep through the large arched doors as the sound of singing could be heard. I’m getting more impressed with my homing skills for places I don’t know (though I couldn’t really go far wrong with a village the size of Yetminster). It was really cool meeting lots of people I haven’t seen for ages from yesteryear in YCC and catching up, plus being with the Yeovil posse again.</p>

<p>After juggling antics in France, I thought it would be quite cool to re-live childhood fun and decided to bring up my unicycle ‘The Undercarriage Chaifer’ too. After returning to Cardiff saturday after the wedding, I had to move stuff back in trying not to annoy ‘Ellie’ – the new housemate who I’d never met before. This was more difficult than it sounds, everyone in bed and me trying to move a freezer across the street into the house quietly at 1:30am is unsurprisingly fairly difficult.</p>

<p>Sunday helralded cleaning of said freezer and assembling of unicycle, before going to play in the park with guys on the latter. Tim said my task was to be juggling and unicycling simultaneously by the end of the hour. After a few, slow and short free-mounts I was able to continue back to the house. Talks this week have revealed said housemate is up on circus skills too, so a worthy addition to the house.</p>

<p>Today holds the best news though. It marks the 13 month voyage Tim and I have taken to get our bonds from year 2003-2004 back minus only £1 each for the non-cleaning of window sills in the lounge (which everyone knows is still a hangable offence in some countries) and a further £20 for Tims amusing ‘I think I’ll mop this water off the carpet with the iron’ incident. It’s the end of an era.  </p>
