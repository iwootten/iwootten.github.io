          <p>Although I didn&#8217;t attend it, it sounds like <a href="http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/The_Nth_Festival/19869/p1/">this event</a> held at my church at home in Somerset was an absolute blast &#8211; props to crackers for sorting it!</p>

          <p>Flipping pancakes eh? They&#8217;re crafty beggars they are..</p>
<p>Would you believe that in my 24 years knocking around, I&#8217;d never actually flipped a pancake until this tuesday? You could understand why I might be a little excited about that particular prospect, and a little nervous. I spent my evening with a bunch of girls, in all shapes and sizes (some tall, some short, some insanely strong) to celebrate this occasion, but when my time to shine came, it was all good. </p>
<p>I wonder if anyone has ever tried to juggle pancakes between two frying pans and three pancakes&#8230;could be interesting?</p>

          <p>This post is the official 100th post on this site! Wow, how exciting. I know that it&#8217;s marked up as #127, but these are of the ones that actually made it public here. The first one made it up back in August 03 and <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install/">was rather boring</a>. That makes an average blog per month rating of 3.4&#8230;.Yeah, thats lame too. So, what can I talk about to make it all profound now? Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>This week marked 3 months of Viv and I dating. I suppose I&#8217;m still finding it all rather bizarre a woman being interested in me in that way &#8211; well any way actually! Though she does seem a little confused about which role in the relationship she&#8217;d like to take. Anyway, it has been a great time and I wouldn&#8217;t change any of it. Actually, thats a lie, I wouldn&#8217;t mind changing the part where she didn&#8217;t tell me how she felt when I initially spilled my guts, for maybe 6 months, because I actually thought she despised me with a passion &#8211; yeah that was a fun time. Rant over, I&#8217;m loving it now. This time makes up for a lot of confusion for me back then. Too bad it took her the best part of 25 years to find me.</p>
<p>Did we do anything special? Unfortunately no &#8211; distance a problem here and I got so into my work I actually forgot about it by the end of the day and was still at uni a t 8pm working. Ever the hopeless romantic&#8230;..ah well save all that for that day next month I guess.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a strange photo of the two of us, looking a bit rough.</p>
