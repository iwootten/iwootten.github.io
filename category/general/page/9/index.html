	<p>If I had something interesting to say I would say it, but I don’t really so instead I’ll hit you with a few ebay bargains I’ve picked up of late. Currently I’m holding a rating of 166 positive, I reckon thats pretty good. Anybody else bought anything interesting off the net lately?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4713354993&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">Cut N Paste – Forget It</a> [12” Single] (£1.99). I’ve been after this ever since I heard it on a Fatboy Slim ‘On the Floor at the Boutique’ mix CD donkeys years ago….</li>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;category=64228&#038;item=7952327398">David Nicholls – Starter For Ten</a> [Book] (£0.01). I started this after getting annoyed with reading huge mundane chunks of history in 1984. Loads of this is so close to the truth its scary, I’ve carried stupidly heavy things across Cardiff for instance, more than once actually, just to save a quid or so. Its great, despite being a “Richard and Judy Bookclub Bestseller”.</li>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4707809284&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">LHB – Tell ‘Em Who We Are</a> [CD Album] (£0.99) This is an absolutely amazing album, can’t see how I’ve ever missed it before. Even more so as these guys were once big beat wonders back on good old Bolshi records.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=6157425220&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">4.5M x 0.75M ‘Scrumpy Jack’ banner</a> (£4.00). This is pure comedy value. Just need to find a way of hanging this on the wall…was provided with a few ropes…hmm..</li>

	<p>Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday. Me being a little bit more independant of late, thought sod it and went by myself, getting bought drinks by Phantom Beats (the guy I went to see) while I was there…nice.</p>

<p>I just returned from my actual birthday here at home, bowling…..exciting stuff! Ah well, once again not that many people about, with a distinct lack of things available to do in our small town in Somerset. The cream on the cake is I just discovered on returning, I share my birthday with a great comedian – namely <a href="http://frostitution.net/" title="Fanpage">Nick Frost</a>, star of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead fame. Rock on!</p>

	<h1><a href="/2005/03/14/birthday-blues">Birthday Blues</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">14 Mar 2005</div>
	<p>I’m trying to decide what to do for my birthday which falls on Bank holiday monday this year. Currently I’m of the mind to do something on Good Friday like have a meal, then off to town (Chico Fresco and Phantom Beats will be at bsb apparently)….Leaving me free to go back and have easter and my actual birthday with family and friends. I’m going to be 24…<em>24</em>,<strong>24?!</strong>, no surely thats not right! I still feel about 18 and all my years as an undergrad never happened, I certainly don’t <em>act</em> my age. Ah well, I’ll get over it..It’s not actually that big a deal. I’ll have to anyway, it’ll happen again next year. If anyones about in cardiff then and wants to help me celebrate, please let me know!</p>

<p>I had my first quote immortalised upon our quote board at home, I’m usually quite careful not to say anything stupid with housemates about, thats Tim’s job, but this was due to a recent trip to the bay. I was talking to Cath Evans about my last trip to the bay (on my 20th birthday co-incidentally), where upon we were set upon by a load of kids off of the estate who decided to throw rocks at us whilst waiting for the train. Anyway it reads <em>“This is my first trip to the bay since we got stoned on my birthday.”</em> I think a lot of people on the train got an unintended impression of me after that conversation.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2005/02/21/fun-packed-weekends">Fun Packed Weekends</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">21 Feb 2005</div>
	<p>My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It’s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.</p>

<p>This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis’s in Swansea for a bit to say hi. We spent the afternoon shopping at Tesco’s and choosing each other’s various toiletry related items! Great chance to see where she’s been living (pretty much across the road from where she did previously), hang out and watch trashy tv with one another (Go Chunk).</p>

<p>I spent monday over at Viv’s “Chocolate Evening” with her and Zoe watching Dodgeball, which was a laugh a minute… I think I’d been on a bit of a downer that day and thats just what I needed. I think it might of been a slight overkill on the chocolate though.</p>

<p>Thursday was of course my first appearance under my dj pseudonym “Scrumpy Jack” (keeping it real – from my roots of Somerset), I was a bit unimpressed by my performance, no matter what mates say, but it was cool to play in the Welsh club – what a “proper” club should be. This kind of inspired me to knock out a mix (one of the longest I’ve done in a while) on Saturday afternoon. I might shove it somewhere on the web if I can find a suitable place. Dodgy in places, but I don’t really care as I hadn’t prepared at all for it.</p>

<p>Checked out the “off the shelf” guys on Friday night – some mad jungle biznis till late into the night. Yesterday evening involved building a large fire on the beach and some random plank walking over it by peeps. Very nice evening, moonlit beach all to ourselves, extremely cool. The highlight of the evening had to be Carl and Meilyr running away from a random welsh guys car after checking that he hadn’t rigged up some sophisticated suicide routine while we’d been in the pub, and had actually just fallen asleep.</p>

<p>Next week I’m off to see the parentals in Yeovil, which is nice…..</p>

<div class="author_meta">07 Jan 2005</div>
	<p>So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life…boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John’s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.</p>

<p>I had a wicked time over New Years with the Southampton/Cardiff posse in Beddgelert, climbing Snowdon and enduring other peoples (mostly Stephen’s) sleeping habits. New Years Eve was especially great due to the copius amounts of party items that were flung our way by the local’s landlord. Check out the images here:  </p>

Luckily, it&#8217;s billed as a birthday party for Waldron so hopefully there&#8217;ll be a bit of a different atmosphere than normal.

<div class="author_meta">09 Dec 2004</div>
	<p>Can it be December already? What have I been doing? Wheres the last 3 months gone? I have to say I feel more Christmas-sy this year in Cardiff than I have ever been up here. </p>

<p>There seems to have been a bit of a build up so far.. Watching “Bad Santa” back in Nov (quite possibly the most amount of swearing I’ve ever seen in a film), going to Germany the other week with all the festive fun over there. Now a flurry of meals and events in Cardiff before shipping back to Somerset and seeing all me ol’ muckers back there…man the other 3 years spent here seem well depressing compared to this! Not that actually there’s really that much going on now..</p>

<p>I expect they’ll be a number of pics showing events up here at some point, be sure to keep tabs on the gallery.</p>

	<p>Thought I’d have a moan about a few bits and bobs…same old, same old</p>

<p>I had a bit of an interesting experience today when my speedo decided to die halfway to Rhwibina. Could have been worse I guess, could of been on the motorway. Anyway, best get that sorted.</p>

<p>Uni seems to be going ok, the works piling up a bit though. It’s a bit of a nightmare to think about teaching and researching within the same day, takes me ages to adjust and concentrate for that matter. Had a meeting with the other half of the research team in Southampton, so that got me up to speed on a lot of things.</p>

<p>I need to get some djing on the cards, but I’m too whimpish to go ahead and do it. Fear of rejection see. I’m doing nothing in the evenings, which is pretty awful, especially when it gets through to Friday night. Nov 5th brought it home a bit. I’m glad theres loads of other PhD’s about, at least I get a few things done with them, never really had that sort of interaction outside of uni hours with other people on my course as an undergrad.</p>

	<p>I’ve been to so many of my close mates wedding over the last couple of years… In fact I don’t actually think any of the old school crew are still single! Anyway in celebration of this, and Pauls recent marriage to Lisa, I’ve shoved up a gallery to show off some of the pics I have for them.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2004/08/16/update">Update</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 Aug 2004</div>
	<p>Seeing as how I haven’t posted anything here properly for far too long, I thought I’d give an update on everything I’ve been doing since we last spoke..</p>

<p>Firstly, I got my degree, with the grades I wanted, although not perhaps in the subjects I expected to get them in, though I guess thats always the way. As a result of that, I’m going to be staying on at Cardiff for a PhD conducting research into the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="Provenance Aware Service Oriented Architecture">PASOA</a> project over the coming year. I don’t know if I’m fully aware of what this is going to entail either academically or in terms of life the universe and everything. However I figure its best to attack this at this stage of my life when I’ve got no ties, rather than forever regretting it..</p>

<p>When asking for references for my PhD, I sent off a letter to my old place of work <a href="http://www.aeroint.com" title="My old employer">Aerosystems Intenational</a>, where I carried out a placement year upon the support team. On completing my exams and preparing to head off home for a visit to the parents, I recieved a call asking if I’d like to return for the summer.. I accepted, started the following week and hence have been tied up with that for the last 2 months! It’s been really strange being back there, after being away and all, the teams grown a bit and is constantly pulling in contractors to help out. I enjoyed my time back there however, they’re all very friendly.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered a sweet little button in w.bloggar which pulls in my current track from winamp – very cool &lt;div class="media"&gt;
