      <div class="author_meta">14 Jan 2006</div>

          <p>On the dawning of a new year, life continues much the same as it has done previously, I have lots of work to do, lots of pointless things to do and lots of people who want me to fix their computers because they heard I know a little about those sorts of things. On my quest to rid the world of all t-shirts by stocking up on them myself, I&#8217;d quite like to pick up <a href="http://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=GADG&amp;title=710114&amp;p=432&amp;g=532&amp;pa=genbrw#" title="Geeky T-Shirts">this t-shirt</a> to reflect how I sometimes feel about this. I may as well not beat around the bush. Although I do occasionally do like to do some alternate computing things in my spare time it seems I end up doing it incessantly, which really makes it a hideous attribute to possess and leaves me with very little free time at all. The period at home over Chistmas really brought this up too. Oh well, I am a geek and am burdened with the full package which comes with it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">05 Jan 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve not spoken in a long time on here and it seems I&#8217;m getting harassed into doing so, so I thought I&#8217;d air some stuff.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the New Year! Woohoo! Christmas brought with it all the usual stuff, like parents moaning about computers and arguing about nothing. This year I only crept back for a very short time in which to see family and catch up. It seems like Yeovil is less and less like my home now, with friends moving away and all. I didn&#8217;t really get to see anyone much, but did spy Mike and Nathans new houses while I was back. Its really strange to see people moving forward in that respect, their places seem huge, but then they&#8217;ve been working forever &#8211; did I take the wrong track? What would my life be like if?, are questions I constantly ask myself&#8230;</p>
<p>I spent lots of time doing various holiday type things&#8230;went away for New Year to <a href="http://peacehaven.org.uk/">Sidmouth, Devon</a>. I managed to tow Viv along as well although she did just sleep through most of everything. She was feeling a bit poorly so was left to sleep that off, but then you have to add the normal sleep regime as well, so thats a whole lotta sleeping. We got a bit confusled on the beach and accidentally lost everyone in a big cave &#8211; which there was talk of spending New Year in, but I think the weather didn&#8217;t really cater for this. I didn&#8217;t ever see it but apparently it was quite spectacular. Viv quite cleverly fell asleep on said beach, I got lots of weird looks from bypassers (presumeably wondering what on earth I&#8217;d done&#8230;.) and a dog almost thought she was a tree&#8230;and then it rained&#8230;.hard.</p>
<p>Also been spending time with the Matthias&#8217;, joking having a laugh etc, etc. It&#8217;s been ace, I even benefited to the tune of 3 next tops by playing Mario and letting females go off and guess sizes (they guessed Jon&#8217;s size poorly). We&#8217;ve fed ducks in the sunset, thrown stones at beaches and tried to kill one another via remote sumo over the last month. Good times.</p>
<p>This time of year usually marks a milestone of some sort in terms of relection, but I shant ponder too much right now. Suffice to say I&#8217;m hopeful and really excited, so am looking forward to it. I guess the only reality check right now is the mountain of work ahead to wade through. Roll on the weekend.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">05 Dec 2005</div>

          <p>I cleaned out one of the boxes of papers kicking around my room the other evening. In it, I found an old lunch pass from school (featuring a photo sporting a lovely little version of me) and lots of old encouragement sheets we used to pass around our youth group to gets lots of positive comments on ourselves. Most of these are at least 5 years old and some stretch back to 10. Here are a few of my favourites. If you&#8217;re an old mate, you might find something you&#8217;ve written. I particularly love the one about being &#8220;reasonably safe&#8221;. </p>
<ul>

<li>Ian, you&#8217;re fantastic. You&#8217;re such a good bloke and are always making me laugh. Your faithfulness to God is really cool and its been great seeing you grow in him this last year or two. May God keep blessing you in your life and in your music. Thanks for being a cool friend.</li>

      <div class="author_meta">04 Dec 2005</div>

          <p>On Thursday morning, Maggie, our eldest labrador at home was taken to the vet to be put down. She&#8217;d been poorly for sometime and had become unable to walk, for any reason whatsoever. Maggie was a member of our family for the past 13 years, so it&#8217;s understandably a bit of a loss to us all. It&#8217;s strange to think back to when we first got her, making apologies to numerous teachers for the state the new books I&#8217;d been given had gotten into so quickly. My first attempt at constructing a sentence in german was down to her. Throughout her life she enjoyed many long walks, swims, knock-out runs at mum, putting energetic young scamps (Rex) back into line and any food she could get her paws on.</p>
<p>So long mags, you&#8217;ll be missed.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">29 Nov 2005</div>

          <p>I spent the weekend back at home in recognition of my parents 30th wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s quite bizarre looking through their wedding photos (I&#8217;d never seen them before) and picking out all my relatives in mini form. Said previous ladyfriend decided she&#8217;d brave the border as well to make those &#8220;all important&#8221; first introductions. She might of thought better of it if she knew parentals were going to bring their saturday night party back to ours and keep everyone awake until the early hours.</p>
<p>I got to see all my fabulous pals as well as witness the dedication of Jase and Stephs daughter Eden at the service on Sunday with lots of fireworks type &#8220;ooh&#8217;s and ahh&#8217;s&#8221; from the elderly members to express her cuteness. As a gesture of thanks, the Helyars bought everyone there a doughnut, putting my previous contributions to Vineyard somewhat to shame.</p>
<p>After a detour to clarks village with Paul tagging along (after a number of bump starts &#8211; remember to keep the keys in the ignition mate), we made it back to Cardiff and headed off to see the amazing Prodigy. I was so tired by now it was ridiculous, I used to remember home as a quiet place, it didn&#8217;t seem to be the case this visit but still somehow managed to roll up at the CIA. The warm up act (Audio Bully&#8217;s) really sucked big time, and it was quite amusing to hear the roar as the first track from the dj&#8217;s came on afterwards. Anyway, after feeling suitably psyched, Paul, I and the large group in the bit that formed around us spent the next 2 hours going mental to all the classics, without a black eye in sight. Lot&#8217;s of fond childhood memories came flooding back of music sharing in Pauls living room. Twas brill it twas.</p>
