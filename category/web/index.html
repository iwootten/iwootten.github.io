      <div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2013</div>

          <p>10 years ago today, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That&#8217;s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that&#8217;s quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 &#8220;weblog tool&#8221;</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>
<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed &#8211; I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently &#8211; which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I&#8217;m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I&#8217;m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it&#8217;s the moments I don&#8217;t share that are most important to me.</p>
<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 May 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been looking back at the posts on this site and the commitment that I supposedly made (internally) a couple of months ago about posting regular, interesting content. But it seemed to die a death very promptly.</p>
<p>I think that there may be a bit of a vicious circle here (in my own situation at least). I&#8217;d love to post regular interesting stuff, but for that to happen I need to feel that it might be read. By far the most commented stuff here is when I link up code. Those posts take a fairly substantial amount of time for me to complete as they are born of the result of my own frustration of hours spent tinkering with code, which I think might be useful for others to be clued up on. I also need time to gather my thoughts and structure what exactly I&#8217;m trying to say to people. This all adds up.</p>
<p>If I post more often, I fear the lesser quality of content might be pretty boring for the majority of people and probably not at all worthy of feedback from them. So I end up in a kind of stalemate position &#8211; should I post this/shouldn&#8217;t I/Oo-er and I don&#8217;t do anything. I&#8217;m not saying that I have a massive amount of visitors here, I&#8217;d just like them to enjoy the experience when they visit.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/01/31/are-music-blogs-getting-a-raw-deal">Are Music Blogs getting a Raw Deal?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">31 Jan 2009</div>

          <p>I can&#8217;t help but feel a little sorry for music blogs as of late. I&#8217;m sure you may be familiar with <a href="http://hypem.com">The Hype Machine</a> and may use it on a daily basis. For the uninitiated, it is essentially a music blog aggregator, which takes details of tracks and ranks them based on how often they appear and how popular they are. I&#8217;ve found it really interesting to browse around and discover new artists.</p>
<p>However, lately I&#8217;ve been wondering if these blogs are getting a raw deal. From my own personal experience, I can say that recommending music takes a lot of time and effort, especially if you decide to go into detail about your choices. Often, the recommendations which the Hype Machine scans are sourced from <a href="http://soul-sides.com/2009/01/spinners-spin-with-me.html">long</a> <a href="http://discontentblog.com/?p=313">detailed</a> <a href="http://electrorash.com/touch-typist/">blog posts</a>, which I&#8217;d say were put together to provide some context for why the author made those choices on any particular day. These aren&#8217;t put up quickly without little thought. However, I generally never look at these posts when listening to music from the hype machine, as I&#8217;m after that next great track fix. I can&#8217;t imagine that these blogs get much traffic that translates into loyal visitors from the machine. I&#8217;ve previously also heard that many of these blogs get a huge amount of their bandwidth eaten up from the number of downloads/streaming they get as a result. I don&#8217;t know who is to blame here, or if indeed this problem exists, whether the blogs are providing unneccessary background information or getting good results from the machine, but I still feel a little sorry for them all the same.</p>
<p>[Update 2/2/08: One thing I forgot to mention here is that there are alternative services offering a different way of providing music recommendations. I recently discovered the <a href="http://peoplesmusicstore.com">Peoples Music Store</a> which allows users to make music recommendations within their own unique stores. The users get 10% of the sale if people decide to purchase from their stores. I really like the idea, but I&#39;d imagine people might take these recommendations and purchase somewhere cheaper, like amazon.]</p>

          <p>Did you know that not only can <a href="http://rightmove.co.uk">http://rightmove.co.uk</a> hunt down all the prices of current houses for sale in your area, it will also give you the prices that houses have gone for for the last 7 years? I didn&#8217;t, but tonight I enjoyed checking out the fact that someone bought a house in my road for &pound;40k in January (but I think either this is a typo, or the place is a hole!) and in 2001 I could have got one for &pound;10k. If only I&#8217;d taken Mum and Dad on that offer of a property back in my first year of Uni, I&#8217;d have made an absolute bundle.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2007/03/08/openid-the-end-of-multiple-passwords">OpenID - The end of multiple passwords?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">08 Mar 2007</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been hearing some really good stuff about <a href="http://openid.net">openID</a> recently. For those who don&#8217;t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It&#8217;s recently risen to light with the adoption by <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/03/06/openid/">WordPress.com</a> as a provider and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/20/kevin-rose-at-fowa-digg-adopts-openid/">digg</a> as an adopter.<a href="http://webwebusability.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/wordpress-openid-not-really/">Complaints</a> against wordpress.com&#8217;s non-allowance of logins with openID&#8217;s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded. For those whom wordpress.com is not their original openID provider, it means that creation of these accounts will go unused and the identity problem seems to be perpetuated somewhat. If you do have your own domain, you can go ahead and <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/03/07/use-your-own-url-not-wordpresscoms-as-your-openid">create your own openID account there</a>, but you won&#8217;t be able to sign into wordpress.com with it.I had an idea off of the back of coming up with a memorable name for an application which makes use of openID as I read this this morning, but after a look around, it seems its <a href="http://fabricoffolly.blogspot.com/2007/03/to-z-of-online-profile-aggregators.html">already been done to death</a>. Alas, this is always the way. The offering by the PhD students over at <a href="http://claimid.com">claimID</a> looks great and is just the sort of thing I&#8217;ve been looking for. I may give it a bash at some point, although someones comment that it looked too much like &#8220;chlamydia.com&#8221;, probably would put me off putting it down on a cv.There&#8217;s lots of useful examples and information at <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/">openID enabled</a>. You can see a short (5 min) video about openID <a href="http://ignitenight.blip.tv/file/154407/">here</a>, presented by Scott Kveton, CEO of <a href="http://janrain.com/">JanRain</a>, who build identity services for the web.</p>
