<div class="author_meta">14 Nov 2006</div>
	<p>The amazing Zach Braff has made an appearance over at <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/657/Some_Choices_Are_Just_Out_of_Reach">threadless</a> to show off the t-shirt which was designed to promote his new film, “The Last Kiss”. Apparently according to the <a href="http://www.threadless.com/loves/thelastkiss">audio interview</a> he gave, he also was going to try to wear it on scrubs at some point, with a cheeky reference to the film. It’s also featuring as part of their current $10 sale in the run up to christmas. I myself have purchased 3 more to add to my collection. Although its nice, Zach’s design wasn’t one of them.<center>

</center>*Looking at the image a bit closer, it looks as if this indeed might be the Scrubs set.</p>

<div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2006</div>
	<p>I’ve been following a number of so called “web 2.0″ companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It’s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I’d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there’s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I’ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I’d be very interested. I’m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck……</p>

<div class="author_meta">14 Sep 2006</div>
	<p>I’ve been suffering at the hands of the sheer size of the web recently. Just starting off at popurls yields many hours spent just browsing randomly across many, many web buzz sites. Although its all very interesting, its not particularly useful to my research, or in fact my own projects.</p>

	<p>Interestingly, two of my most used sites hotmail and ebay, seem to be unavailable at the moment for me to peruse in my daily late night browsing routine. Maybe ntl is doing something stupid at the moment, in fact this is most likely the problem as large amounts of images around the web are unable to be displayed for one reason or another.</p>

	<p>Currently, I’ve been spending many an hour pondering domain name choices for a fair trade t-shirt site I’d like to set-up, but never actually committing to one, due to the rather lacklustre responses of others on hearing my suggestions, or not finding anything suitable which conveys what I am trying to get across (a hip, trendy t-shirt place, ala <a href="http://www.threadless.com" title="Threadless">threadless.com</a>).If anyone can think of anything clever – let me know.</p>

<div class="author_meta">04 Apr 2006</div>
	<p>I’m always coming up with concepts for websites, but I thought this one was worth blogging about. Basically, my idea is that you give yourself a budget of say 99p on ebay and see what kind of profit you can get from that by selling it again….on ebay… and so on until you flop and lose all your profit, or give up and bag the benefits of being able to spell and take photographs.It might sound stupid, but I believe that there are many key factors which influence the price at which items sell i.e. presentation, description, etc etc. The geeks who are able to make things look pretty and take a few photos might as well take maximum benefit..I went ahead and registered a <a href="http://www.ebayexperiment.com/" title="The Ebay Experiment">domain</a> for it, to hear of others who’d like to give it a go too. I might even start – that is if I can find an item worthy of gaining profit with for 99p!</p>

<div class="author_meta">17 Mar 2006</div>
	<p>A few weeks ago, I noticed that worpdress.com, org and net weren’t registered, despite their similarity to the excellent blogging tool wordpress’s <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="wordpress.org">domain</a>. I thought it was too good an opportunity to be missed, and registered the lot of them.After a couple of posts on the wordpress forums, and the realisation that there was no way in hell I’d ever have the time to put anything there, I decided to donate them to Matt Mullenweg, so at least they were redirecting the one or two people who might hit them to the correct wordpress site.I sent a short email to Matt, whom I didn’t actually expect to reply – but to my surprise he did, and after a bit of searching round on godaddy for domain transferal technique (rather than re-registration), successfully switched them to his command. I hope they are of use to the person whom is technically this sites creator.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2006/03/06/digg-it">Digg It</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">06 Mar 2006</div>
	<p>I’ve recently, through many searches to do with AJAX, Web 2.0 and the like been perusing <a href="http://digg.com">digg.com</a>, that fairly new web site for geeks.Basically, it’s a social booking marking site where users “digg” those sites which they find interesting, as more users digg the same pages, they get promoted up through to the main page, or higher up through the rankings within particular categories. Its a really interesting concept, quite similar to <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, but mainly centred on techie news, which means I end up reading it forever.The best part I think though is the <a href="http://digg.com/spy">digg spy</a> – which allows you to see (through a fancy ajax system) which diggs are being made right now.As an example of interesting links I’ve found, check out <a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=233460">these insanely realistic renders</a> of various interiors.</p>

<div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2003</div>
	<p>So, I’ve installed <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> on my website. I figured it was about time that I get up to speed on this whole “Blogging” thing, but I could of even missed the bus already.</p>

<p>I’ve spent half of the evening just looking at what can be done with MT, and it seems to integrate well with <a href="http://www.invisionboard.com/"> Invision Board</a> as the MT crew have an example of a forum set up with it on their site. On the other hand it could just be a good hack.</p>

<p>You might wonder why I’ve chosen MT over <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. Basically its just aesthetics – I think that MT looks very pretty compared with Drupal, and it seems to be pretty well supported to boot.</p>
