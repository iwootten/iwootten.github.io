      <div class="author_meta">14 Nov 2006</div>

          <p>The amazing Zach Braff has made an appearance over at <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/657/Some_Choices_Are_Just_Out_of_Reach">threadless</a> to show off the t-shirt which was designed to promote his new film, &#8220;The Last Kiss&#8221;. Apparently according to the <a href="http://www.threadless.com/loves/thelastkiss">audio interview</a> he gave, he also was going to try to wear it on scrubs at some point, with a cheeky reference to the film. It&#8217;s also featuring as part of their current $10 sale in the run up to christmas. I myself have purchased 3 more to add to my collection. Although its nice, Zach&#8217;s design wasn&#8217;t one of them.<center>

</center>*Looking at the image a bit closer, it looks as if this indeed might be the Scrubs set.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been following a number of so called &#8220;web 2.0&#8243; companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It&#8217;s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I&#8217;d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I&#8217;ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I&#8217;d be very interested. I&#8217;m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck&#8230;&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been suffering at the hands of the sheer size of the web recently. Just starting off at popurls yields many hours spent just browsing randomly across many, many web buzz sites. Although its all very interesting, its not particularly useful to my research, or in fact my own projects.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Jun 2006</div>

          <p>Interestingly, two of my most used sites hotmail and ebay, seem to be unavailable at the moment for me to peruse in my daily late night browsing routine. Maybe ntl is doing something stupid at the moment, in fact this is most likely the problem as large amounts of images around the web are unable to be displayed for one reason or another.</p>
