          <p>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my &#8220;business&#8221; cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing &#8220;beta&#8221; on hand hand-made ones or something&#8230;</p>

          <p>Yes, yes I know I already posted about the <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/08/08/fowa-roadtrip-bristol/">FOWA Roadtrip in Bristol</a>, but I live in Cardiff and have friends and <a href="http://www.gr0w.com">colleagues in Bristol too</a>. I promise I didn&#8217;t just head there for free drinks once again. This time the <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems team</a> had pulled together some funky little <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/">FOWA Roadtrip</a> badges that they handed out on the door, rather than the stickers at Bristol. I&#8217;d previously learned that Ryan&#8217;s wife, Gillian had taken a MSc in Cardiff and it seems the same is true of <a href="http://carsonsystems.com/about.html">Lisa Price</a> too. I had a really interesting conversation with Lisa about how Future Publishing (whom she previously worked for) produced one of my favourite mags (PCFormat) back in my adolescence. (I actually still own all the magazines I bought for like 3 years and harbour plans to ship them back to Future in Bath, along with all the CDs).</p>
<p>Anyway, it was grand that those who were involved in the web app scene in Cardiff finally made it to an event together, and our newly formed <a href="http://cardiffgeeks.net">Cardiff Geeks</a> group is already scheming to stage another meet up for geeky people. (It&#8217;s a good label, it&#8217;s a nerd you don&#8217;t want to be).</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve long wondered why there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much happening in terms of community of the web professionals in wales. There is a vibrant collection of people sporting different skill sets in the area, yet as I can see not a lot of chat amongst everyone in between different groups. On a whim, I decided to create a facebook group &#8220;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5399328503">Cardiff Web Geeks</a>&#8221; to try and get people to come out of their shells and actually participate in a bit of discussion about tech topics in wales. I&#8217;ve invited a bunch of people who might be interested and hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to organise some sort of chats and discussions at meetups, rather than having to cross the border back to England and sponge from our friends over there. (Each one of those return trips costs&#8230;) If you are interested in what&#8217;s going on with people and the web in Wales, I&#8217;d invite you to sign up and participate in what hopefully could be built into a nice valuable community in our local area. </p>
<p>[Update - We now have our own <a href="http://cardiffgeeks.net">website</a>! Rock on!]</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Aug 2007</div>

          <p>Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of <a href="http://carsonified.com">Ryan Carsons</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Applications</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/raodtrip">Roadtrip</a>. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down. Luckily, at about 6.30pm the line opened up again and I made it over to Bristol. I&#8217;d met up with Evan Rudowski and Jo(?) of <a href="http://www.subhub.com">SubHub</a> prior at Cardiff station and therefore headed over with them.</p>
<p>It was a good evening, with me able to catch up with <a href="http://jontangerine.com">Jon</a> and <a href="http://dotjay.co.uk">Jon</a> of the <a href="http://gr0w.com">Grow Collective</a> (with whom I shall hopefully be working with very soon, but more on that later). I don&#8217;t think I ever used the free drink I was entitled too with my lovely check sticker Ryan graced me with. A similar event is happening in Cardiff on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip">10th September over in the bay</a>, if you&#8217;re a web type in wales you&#8217;d probably do well to check it out.</p>
<p>Update: there&#8217;s more info on the event on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/thanks-bristol/">Future of Web Apps blog</a>. I even made it into a couple of photos, albeit adorning a rucksack. The fire in Newport <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6936270.stm">completely destroyed a row of houses</a>. I guess I didn&#8217;t have it that bad&#8230;</p>
