	<p>So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">ROKR E1</a> – a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> – a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod – how many have there been now? There’s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3′s just yet – except my portable fat hard drive. We’ll have to wait until that Toshiba 80Gb model see’s the light of day, but then that’d still be cutting it rather close. Anyway, thats not what the nano’s about…</p>

<p>I’m not the most avid enthusiast when it come to apple products, but this thing features a sporty colour screen supposedly for photo display and is tiny!</p>

<div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2005</div>
	<p>These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj’ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe’s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I’m a bit out of practice. </p>

<p>Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band <a href="http://www.walkingwounded.co.uk">“Walking Wounded”</a> all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don’t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support). One of the conversations I had while I was there was with the infamous Carl (who was playing some crazy dub and reggae), revealing the sad news that Fridays <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com">“off the shelf”</a> at BSB is to come to an end. Its a bit of a shame, the guys had a great set-up there, gave me the odd gig offer now and then and I’ve met a fair few randoms through events they’ve put on, always enjoying it due to all the guys having a sound appreciation of good music. So long…</p>

<p>An afterparty from Zoe’s meant a bit of a late one on Friday, although a night absolutely chocka of funky soul, breaks and beats from full-fat at Moloko’s. It was a great night, great music and a great change to be making such a trip with a posse rather than being a loner. The same can be said of last night, due to the trip over to Bristol for Jurassic 5′s performance. Although <a href="http://www.cutchemist.com">Cut Chemist</a> wasn’t there, Numark absolutely rocked the place with the solo’s he’d put together, with one crazy “do-wop” solo. It was fab to finally see him in action, after all the vids I’ve watched of him with Chemist and DJ Shadow. I stunk so much of weed when I returned it was disgusting.</p>

<p>Anyway, seems I’ve been inspired to check out a few random artists on Warp, namely Brothemstates (did the music for the Sprite ad) and the Rip Off Artist from Kid 606′s Tigerbeat Label. I also ordered the KEEPINTIME dvd off ninjatune by, er, pretty much everyone :). <a href="http://www.warprecords.com">Warp</a> and <a href="http://www.ninjatune.net">Ninjatune</a> are both having sales of sorts at the moment if you’re interested.</p>

<div class="author_meta">01 Aug 2005</div>
	<p>I’ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I’d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it’s quite the opposite really.</p>

<p>My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it’s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase. If you download or copy cd’s with no intention of rewarding those who created it with payment of some way shape or form, I’m sorry, I really can’t see it as a good thing. You might argue that fat cats mark up media with artificially high prices, with little going to the original artists, but it’s untrue for the most part (there are a huge number of people involved in producing most albums) and goes a short way as to why you should award those artists with no payment whatsoever…these artists do after all sign contracts and know what they’re getting themselves into for the most part.</p>

<p>Admittedly, there are occasions where my opinions blur. In the case of mix cd’s, I see the cd as a showcase for the DJ’s mixing skills, as well as those songs upon it, so I’d quite happily download mixes from the net. If there is a good track within, I’ll add it to my collection anyway, the majority of the dance music scene seems to encourage these methods anyway – getting their artists to produce mixes and distribute them online so people buy the bare, unmixed, tracks. It gets really messy with the issue of sampling – I’m not even going there….</p>

<p>What’s a little more scary, is the attitude Christians take to piracy. I’ve known in the past Christians quite happily pirating software worth thousands to produce albums or websites for projects in the Church, with little or no concern for what they’re doing. Surely there’s something wrong there – making Church websites with stolen software? The majority of the time its simply not necessary for the tasks in hand either, there are other ways of achieving the results in a more ethical way. (Ask me if you want to know how)… I’m probably more sensitive in this area, due to the fact I create software myself.</p>

<p>I was really disturbed when I first got into sharing applications as a teenager at the volume of Christian music available, Delerious, Redman, Jars of Clay, you want it its there…it seems we’re just as bad as the rest of the world here. The Gospel Music Association even has the stats to <a href="http://www.cmta.com/research.htm" title="GMA">prove it</a>. The Bible calls for us to ‘abide by the laws of the land’ because such authorities ‘have been established by God’ (Romans 13:1-7) – if we’re going against them we’re going against God. I can’t see that laws for copyrighting music, films go against what God says, so really we have no reason for being so lax in this department.</p>

<p>I was reading a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0851112587/qid%3D1122935165/026-6844478-8087659" title="Amazon">Net Commandments</a> back along which describes how easy technology has made it for us to sin (or cybersin – but that sounds like you need a peripheral). Not only this, but its also removed a large majority of the barriers which have been in place which otherwise may have presented us from sinning. I’d love to see some of us going into Virgin and using our MD to record the album we’re sampling at the listening point, it’d never happen.</p>

	<p>I was a right little Heathen yesterday and skived off of housegroup to meet up with Mr Bryer in Bristol to see the awesome <a href="http://www.lemonjelly.ky" title="Lemon Jelly">Lemon Jelly</a>. Whats even better was the fact that <a href="http://www.sonicflux.co.uk">Ben Lilford</a> had come along too, unbeknown to me before arriving. They are quite literally the most amusing band ever. Prior to the Jel’s entrance we were treated to Don Partridge (a one man band) whilst trying to play a couple of party games (find 3 stooges hidden in the audience).</p>

<p>I think the best moment of the evening was everyone was dancing to the vocal from “Nice Weather For Ducks” over some really heavy beats. It’s taken from an old nursery rhyme and goes <em>“All the ducks are swimming in the water, fah la la la rahldo, fah la la la rahldo”</em> or something like that, you can hear a more downtempo version <a href="http://www.cissme.com/bgroup-us/rm/xl/lemon/video/ifxls156dvd-01_rvh.ram">here</a>. It’s got to be the only place I’m ever gonna be dancing alongside a horde of drunken louts (one of which insisting at making <em>the</em> most annoying moose sound after every track), one very sweet and tiny little old lady and still feel content. </p>

	<p>Ok, not to totally contradict my last post, I’ve just read a comedy web page all about me that was put up 5 years ago which I never knew existed! You might like to take a look <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/presence/dj.htm">here</a>. It seems my music tastes haven’t changed all that much, as the songs I quote are all still top tunes…I may of gotten all technical for no reason.</p>

<div class="author_meta">27 Feb 2005</div>
	<p>I’m finding quite a lot at the moment that my music stirs up far more emotion in me than ever before. I don’t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is “all about the music”. Tim’s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that? (There’s another amazing quirk God’s blessed man with). I also heard that as your body ages, your ear becomes more succeptable to particular frequencies, possibly causing some kind of change in our musical tastes, due to some frequencies being more common in particular pieces of music. (I have no way of backing that up, so any medics might not like to ever bring that up in conversation with me). All this is a round about way of saying I think my music tastes have matured as I’ve got older…who’d of thought eh?</p>

<div class="author_meta">24 Jan 2005</div>
	<p>I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic…! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I’d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!) and Jools and Eric Clapton’s finale. What was quite gutting was the fact I was stuck in a queue when the Manics were on, so I didn’t even see them on the stage…. <img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>

<p>I felt it kind of patronising though to be sitting there in a huge concert, with all these amazing artists, while the real reason we were there was to provide support for all those poor people who’d suffered through this horrible ordeal. It was almost like we were celebrating such a tragic event, rather than mourning over it. For some reason I don’t look at “Live Aid” in the same kind of light, I expect it’s because I wasn’t really there to witness it (being 3 and not understanding and all). I suppose events such as these do do a fantastic job of bringing media attention about though, not that there’s really any need at the moment, it’s all the news seems to cover at the moment (and why not? It is after all the most tragic natural disaster since I don’t know when). I don’t know where I’m going with this… that was perhaps a little deep for me.</p>

<p>Anyways, here are links to some pics of the event. They gradually deteriorate in quality, so Jools and Eric aren’t looking at their best I’m afraid.   </p>
