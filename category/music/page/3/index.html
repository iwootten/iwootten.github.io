          <p>So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">ROKR E1</a> &#8211; a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> &#8211; a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod &#8211; how many have there been now? There&#8217;s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3&#8242;s just yet &#8211; except my portable fat hard drive. We&#8217;ll have to wait until that Toshiba 80Gb model see&#8217;s the light of day, but then that&#8217;d still be cutting it rather close. Anyway, thats not what the nano&#8217;s about&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the most avid enthusiast when it come to apple products, but this thing features a sporty colour screen supposedly for photo display and is tiny!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj&#8217;ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe&#8217;s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I&#8217;m a bit out of practice. </p>
<p>Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band <a href="http://www.walkingwounded.co.uk">&#8220;Walking Wounded&#8221;</a> all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support). One of the conversations I had while I was there was with the infamous Carl (who was playing some crazy dub and reggae), revealing the sad news that Fridays <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com">&#8220;off the shelf&#8221;</a> at BSB is to come to an end. Its a bit of a shame, the guys had a great set-up there, gave me the odd gig offer now and then and I&#8217;ve met a fair few randoms through events they&#8217;ve put on, always enjoying it due to all the guys having a sound appreciation of good music. So long&#8230;</p>
<p>An afterparty from Zoe&#8217;s meant a bit of a late one on Friday, although a night absolutely chocka of funky soul, breaks and beats from full-fat at Moloko&#8217;s. It was a great night, great music and a great change to be making such a trip with a posse rather than being a loner. The same can be said of last night, due to the trip over to Bristol for Jurassic 5&#8242;s performance. Although <a href="http://www.cutchemist.com">Cut Chemist</a> wasn&#8217;t there, Numark absolutely rocked the place with the solo&#8217;s he&#8217;d put together, with one crazy &#8220;do-wop&#8221; solo. It was fab to finally see him in action, after all the vids I&#8217;ve watched of him with Chemist and DJ Shadow. I stunk so much of weed when I returned it was disgusting.</p>
<p>Anyway, seems I&#8217;ve been inspired to check out a few random artists on Warp, namely Brothemstates (did the music for the Sprite ad) and the Rip Off Artist from Kid 606&#8242;s Tigerbeat Label. I also ordered the KEEPINTIME dvd off ninjatune by, er, pretty much everyone :). <a href="http://www.warprecords.com">Warp</a> and <a href="http://www.ninjatune.net">Ninjatune</a> are both having sales of sorts at the moment if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">01 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I&#8217;d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it&#8217;s quite the opposite really.</p>
<p>My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it&#8217;s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase. If you download or copy cd&#8217;s with no intention of rewarding those who created it with payment of some way shape or form, I&#8217;m sorry, I really can&#8217;t see it as a good thing. You might argue that fat cats mark up media with artificially high prices, with little going to the original artists, but it&#8217;s untrue for the most part (there are a huge number of people involved in producing most albums) and goes a short way as to why you should award those artists with no payment whatsoever&#8230;these artists do after all sign contracts and know what they&#8217;re getting themselves into for the most part.</p>
<p>Admittedly, there are occasions where my opinions blur. In the case of mix cd&#8217;s, I see the cd as a showcase for the DJ&#8217;s mixing skills, as well as those songs upon it, so I&#8217;d quite happily download mixes from the net. If there is a good track within, I&#8217;ll add it to my collection anyway, the majority of the dance music scene seems to encourage these methods anyway &#8211; getting their artists to produce mixes and distribute them online so people buy the bare, unmixed, tracks. It gets really messy with the issue of sampling &#8211; I&#8217;m not even going there&#8230;.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s a little more scary, is the attitude Christians take to piracy. I&#8217;ve known in the past Christians quite happily pirating software worth thousands to produce albums or websites for projects in the Church, with little or no concern for what they&#8217;re doing. Surely there&#8217;s something wrong there &#8211; making Church websites with stolen software? The majority of the time its simply not necessary for the tasks in hand either, there are other ways of achieving the results in a more ethical way. (Ask me if you want to know how)&#8230; I&#8217;m probably more sensitive in this area, due to the fact I create software myself.</p>
<p>I was really disturbed when I first got into sharing applications as a teenager at the volume of Christian music available, Delerious, Redman, Jars of Clay, you want it its there&#8230;it seems we&#8217;re just as bad as the rest of the world here. The Gospel Music Association even has the stats to <a href="http://www.cmta.com/research.htm" title="GMA">prove it</a>. The Bible calls for us to &#8216;abide by the laws of the land&#8217; because such authorities &#8216;have been established by God&#8217; (Romans 13:1-7) &#8211; if we&#8217;re going against them we&#8217;re going against God. I can&#8217;t see that laws for copyrighting music, films go against what God says, so really we have no reason for being so lax in this department.</p>
<p>I was reading a book called the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0851112587/qid%3D1122935165/026-6844478-8087659" title="Amazon">Net Commandments</a> back along which describes how easy technology has made it for us to sin (or cybersin &#8211; but that sounds like you need a peripheral). Not only this, but its also removed a large majority of the barriers which have been in place which otherwise may have presented us from sinning. I&#8217;d love to see some of us going into Virgin and using our MD to record the album we&#8217;re sampling at the listening point, it&#8217;d never happen.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">10 Mar 2005</div>

          <p>I was a right little Heathen yesterday and skived off of housegroup to meet up with Mr Bryer in Bristol to see the awesome <a href="http://www.lemonjelly.ky" title="Lemon Jelly">Lemon Jelly</a>. Whats even better was the fact that <a href="http://www.sonicflux.co.uk">Ben Lilford</a> had come along too, unbeknown to me before arriving. They are quite literally the most amusing band ever. Prior to the Jel&#8217;s entrance we were treated to Don Partridge (a one man band) whilst trying to play a couple of party games (find 3 stooges hidden in the audience).</p>
<p>I think the best moment of the evening was everyone was dancing to the vocal from &#8220;Nice Weather For Ducks&#8221; over some really heavy beats. It&#8217;s taken from an old nursery rhyme and goes <em>&#8220;All the ducks are swimming in the water, fah la la la rahldo, fah la la la rahldo&#8221;</em> or something like that, you can hear a more downtempo version <a href="http://www.cissme.com/bgroup-us/rm/xl/lemon/video/ifxls156dvd-01_rvh.ram">here</a>. It&#8217;s got to be the only place I&#8217;m ever gonna be dancing alongside a horde of drunken louts (one of which insisting at making <em>the</em> most annoying moose sound after every track), one very sweet and tiny little old lady and still feel content. </p>
