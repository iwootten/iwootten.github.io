          <p>Ok, not to totally contradict my last post, I&#8217;ve just read a comedy web page all about me that was put up 5 years ago which I never knew existed! You might like to take a look <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/presence/dj.htm">here</a>. It seems my music tastes haven&#8217;t changed all that much, as the songs I quote are all still top tunes&#8230;I may of gotten all technical for no reason.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m finding quite a lot at the moment that my music stirs up far more emotion in me than ever before. I don&#8217;t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is &#8220;all about the music&#8221;. Tim&#8217;s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that? (There&#8217;s another amazing quirk God&#8217;s blessed man with). I also heard that as your body ages, your ear becomes more succeptable to particular frequencies, possibly causing some kind of change in our musical tastes, due to some frequencies being more common in particular pieces of music. (I have no way of backing that up, so any medics might not like to ever bring that up in conversation with me). All this is a round about way of saying I think my music tastes have matured as I&#8217;ve got older&#8230;who&#8217;d of thought eh?</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve got my first &#8216;proper&#8217; gig in Cardiff next week, supporting the mighty &#8216;Eberg&#8217; at Clwb Ifor Bach. If you&#8217;re interested, come along, it&#8217;d be good to see you&#8230;  </p>

      <div class="author_meta">24 Jan 2005</div>

          <p>I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic&#8230;! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I&#8217;d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!) and Jools and Eric Clapton&#8217;s finale. What was quite gutting was the fact I was stuck in a queue when the Manics were on, so I didn&#8217;t even see them on the stage&#8230;. <img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>I felt it kind of patronising though to be sitting there in a huge concert, with all these amazing artists, while the real reason we were there was to provide support for all those poor people who&#8217;d suffered through this horrible ordeal. It was almost like we were celebrating such a tragic event, rather than mourning over it. For some reason I don&#8217;t look at &#8220;Live Aid&#8221; in the same kind of light, I expect it&#8217;s because I wasn&#8217;t really there to witness it (being 3 and not understanding and all). I suppose events such as these do do a fantastic job of bringing media attention about though, not that there&#8217;s really any need at the moment, it&#8217;s all the news seems to cover at the moment (and why not? It is after all the most tragic natural disaster since I don&#8217;t know when). I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;m going with this&#8230; that was perhaps a little deep for me.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are links to some pics of the event. They gradually deteriorate in quality, so Jools and Eric aren&#8217;t looking at their best I&#8217;m afraid.</p>
