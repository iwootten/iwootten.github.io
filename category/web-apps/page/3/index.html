          <p>One of the most frustrating things I find about hearing about possible web development jobs on certain sites is the sheer amount of them which are simply unviable due to my UK location. Previously I decided to post all those jobs I could find to my own webtyrant site and the recent <a href="http://djangogigs.com">job</a> and <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jan/23/djangopeople/">profile sites</a> in the django communities has got me thinking about how these two pieces of information on locality could be aggregated together (I don&#8217;t have time myself to do this though unfortunately &#8211; perhaps someone might like to chat about collaborating). What I&#8217;ve concluded is that being aware of those jobs within a certain area might be quite useful &#8211; and simple to implement. What you&#8217;d basically end up with is a situation where you could subscribe to updates on jobs in a particular field within a certain area (think &#8211; &#8220;tell me about all dev jobs within 50 miles&#8221;). Whilst this feature may exist on some other sites (though I&#8217;m unaware of it) my experience tells me that it probably isn&#8217;t executed particularly well.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2007</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve heard a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/would_you_share_your_search_history.php">couple</a> of <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-facebook-app.html">rumours</a> this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&#8217;s some discussion over on <a href="http://facereviews.com/2007/08/28/google-facebook-application-a-hoax/">facereviews.com</a> that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &#8220;social networks&#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for? Probably not at all &#8211; I don&#8217;t want everyone to be clued in to all those random tee sites I&#8217;m able to find. Probably nobody would really be interested, so whats the point anyway?</p>

<p>It also brings to mind an idea that I&#8217;ve been toying with for sharing how links between pages are made, where details of hyperlink clicks are captured to some repository somewhere. This would make it it possible for users to have a series of heatmaps upon any page to display details of common links that other users choose to follow from one page to another, and common routes accross the net to particular pages. Similar issues for whether or not takeup would occur, or the information is indeed useful to everyone exist also.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">12 Apr 2007</div>

          <p>This afternoon I was quite chuffed to discover that I&#8217;d been selected for a Joost beta invite. Joost is, in a nutshell, TV for the web . Kind of the opposite to that Current TV channel on Virgin Media. I&#8217;ve been playing with it this evening, mainly perusing the XL-Recordings and gaming channels.It all seems very good &#8211; a good seelction of channels (for me) straight off, with the ability to search Joost&#8217;s catalog of channels and add more to your collection. The interface (see shots below) is pretty swish and the advertising between shows (The maximum I endured was 2 * 10 second clips) does not detract from the channel content too much. Presumeably these are targeted advertisements, though it didn&#8217;t seem so from the few I watched. There is also the ability to interact in channels and a widget interface. I must point out that Joost is a legal service &#8211; I&#8217;m not in the business of pirating. It uses P2P (peer-to-peer), to distribute content to users &#8211; I had hardly any lags on my measly 2MB connection, although the full-screen content is compressed at quite a low bit rate.Apparently, the Mac version of joost works with the Apple remote, which I could see would make this a very pleasant experience. I think I&#8217;ll be playing with this toy a fair few more times this week.<a href='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.JPG' title='Joost'><img src='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.thumbnail.JPG' alt='Joost' /></a><a href='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.JPG' title='joostinterface2.JPG'><img src='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.thumbnail.JPG' alt='joostinterface2.JPG' /></a><a href='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.JPG' title='joostinterface3.JPG'><img src='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.thumbnail.JPG' alt='joostinterface3.JPG' /></a><a href='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.JPG' title='joostinterface4.JPG'><img src='http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.thumbnail.JPG' alt='joostinterface4.JPG' /></a></p>

          <p>Threadless has launched <a href="http://threadlesskids.com">threadlesskids.com</a> &#8211; like threadless, but for kids. I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis <a href="http://jakeandshondi.com/index/35/The_new_addition">recent announcement</a>. Anyway, it looks wicked &#8211; its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</p>

          <p>If anyone would like to contribute to allow me to attend the <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Apps</a> or the <a href="http://futureofwebdesign.com">Future of Web Design</a> conferences over the next few months, I&#8217;d put together some independent reviews of the events on this site. As the funds of a lowly research student are not all that much cop, you can donate some funds using the <a href="http://webtyrant.com/donate/">donation page</a>.At the moment, registration for Web Apps is £195 + VAT (£595 + VAT including workshops), and Web Design is £59 +VAT.</p>
