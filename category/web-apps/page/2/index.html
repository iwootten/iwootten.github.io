          <p>Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, you&#8217;ll realise that there&#8217;s an uprising against paypal amongst developers. Most of this stems from the multitude of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/paypal-to-regretsy-sorry-_n_1132679.html">crazy requirements</a> they put upon sellers and the locks they can put upon your account without notice.</p>
<p>This in part has led to a number of payment alternatives cropping up. Here in the UK for instance, you have Google checkout and checkout by Amazon pitching up against paypal. None of these solutions are ideal though if you&#8217;re looking to make say, a service that bills on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Enter the subscription billing tools &#8211; there&#8217;s <a href="http://recurly.com/">recurly</a>, <a href="http://chargify.com/">Chargify</a> and <a href="http://saasy.com/">Saasy</a>, to name 3. All of these go some way to ease the management of customer subscriptions. This is great if you have an established banking history as a business and are able to get hold of a merchant account. Not so great for me &#8211; an independent developer with neither of those.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, a full-stack payment processor for developers which has no requirement on merchant accounts or gateways. Integration with your own website is as simple as pasting in some javascript. Sounds great&#8230;..Except I need to be in the US to use it. *Facepalm*. I even had beta access to stripe in it&#8217;s infancy and just had to smile at my invitation code.</p>
<p>Recently here in the UK, <a href="http://gocardless.com">Go Cardless</a> has appeared with an interesting model, based around the use of direct debits to set up subscriptions and make payments. That strikes me as a little weird from a customer point of view. I&#8217;m ok paying my gas by direct debit, but would I be ok paying for a piece of software? Given it&#8217;s unusual for a website to bill this way, I&#8217;d argue most people wouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us independent developers in the UK, Go Cardless really is our best option until Stripe or some other full stack offering lands here. I know Stripe are supposedly working hard on doing so, but payments are at an incredibly frustrating point here right now.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2011/03/31/a-survey-of-hype-in-web-development-podcasts">A Survey of Hype in Web Development Podcasts</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">31 Mar 2011</div>

          <p>I listen to quite a few web dev podcasts. Something that irks me about a lot of them, is how much they tend to hype their own shows, products or the like. Sure, they&#8217;re allowed to, it is their own podcast after all, often from their own businesses etc. I&#8217;m fully aware this all possibly contributes toward the success of shows, but it annoys me nonetheless. </p>
<p>One of these things is the title of the show itself. I don&#8217;t really get why its necessary to repeat the title (Sure I do really, to drum it into my head), given it&#8217;s going to be within the title of the mp3. I know what I&#8217;m listening to after all, because my favourite media player tells me. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to count the number of times a show utters it&#8217;s name over its duration. Sure, I realise this is somewhat ocd and geeky, but hey. Here&#8217;s my results for a typical set of podcasts that I often listen to in a week. I&#8217;ve linked up the data I&#8217;ve used to create this chart on <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiyMcCUnltKwdG85QnNKMnhneUVXMjJNUzVCa0kzNEE&#038;hl=en&#038;pli=1&#038;authkey=CJbb9a0L#gid=0">google spreadsheets</a>, for anyone else who may be interested to contribute to and build upon further. I gathered the data all myself by listening to each podcast and counting when mentions of the show were made but it may be a good excuse for me to experiment with amazon turk. </p>
<p>The big web show comes out tops with one mention over 40 mins worth of show and boagworld comes last with 24 mentions of the show over its duration. (It&#8217;s unfortunate for boagworld that its theme tune includes a voice repeating the title in the theme. I did originally include echos, which would be 34 mentions, but my colleagues inform me this may be taking the experiment a little too far :))</p>
<p>I plan to do the same for product mentions (adverts I guess) in a weeks worth of (different) episodes, but if anyone wants to go ahead and update with their own findings that would be great.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2010/03/21/mixbooth">Mixbooth</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">21 Mar 2010</div>

          <p><a href="http://www.mixbooth.com">Mixbooth</a> is a dj mix hosting service I created several years ago. At the time there wasn&#8217;t a lot around in terms of options for allowing anyone to share them. You either had to exchange it upon a site filled with advertisements, or host it on your own space which might mean you&#8217;d breach your server bandwidth for any given month. I decided to use some space I had available at next to nothing to build something that might be of use to myself and any other dj whom saw fit to use it. It was good at the time and I got quite a buzz out of seeing new uploads appearing and hearing what others had created. I took the decision to end use of <a href="http://www.mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> after about a year of having a couple of mixes a week uploaded. This was mainly due to academic commitments at the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been working on a rebuild of it for some time now. So I&#8217;m letting it loose on those who might be interested. I&#8217;m no longer hosting mixes, but hopefully exchanging useful info on them and those artists who feature within and allowing people to chat about them. It&#8217;s not everything I want it to be right now, but hopefully will serve to a use to djs other than myself. If you want to have a play, head to <a href="http://www.mixbooth.com/signup">www.mixbooth.com/signup</a> and I&#8217;ll get an invite out. I&#8217;ll also be tweeting updates via <a href="http://twitter.com/mixbooth">@mixbooth</a>.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/02/06/stephen-fry-and-the-ascent-of-micro-blogging">Stephen Fry and the Ascent of &quot;Micro Blogging&quot;</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">06 Feb 2009</div>

          <p><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is all over the news at the moment. For the uninitiated, it allows you to list short updates of what you are doing at any time. BBC News seemed to have an all-out assault at the end of January raving about it at every opportunity &#8211; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7834755.stm">the first moments of the Hudson plane landing</a>, an short chat about it by Stephen Fry on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7845823.stm">this short clip on iPlayer</a> by <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/2009/01/29/twitter/">Stephen Fry again</a>. For Stephen Fry, this has meant an insane amount of new followers, indicated by the stats by twittercounter, which are shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://twittercounter.com/stephenfry/month"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/stephenfry-twitcount-300x236.gif" alt="Stephenfry&#039;s Twittercounter" title="Stephenfry Twittercounter" width="300" height="236" class="size-medium wp-image-302" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the stats for 27th January &#8211; a full 20,978 extra followers in a single day! My <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">own profile</a> has a paltry 38 in comparison for all time!, which is about 30 more friends than I actually have offline&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess this huge upsurge is in part due to the fact that Stephen is such a well known comedian in the UK and by no means a stranger to the web. Just yesterday <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/02/stephen-fry-stuck-in-elevator-twittering">Jason Kottke observed his day as deciding &#8220;to start his own reality chat show after becoming stuck in an elevator&#8221;</a>. He also has an <a href="http://stephenfry.com">awesome blog</a> and <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/media/audio/109/series-2-episode-3--language/">podcast</a>. He also is a very open advocate of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu.html">open source</a> and free software. How on earth he finds the time to live both his life virtually and as television celebrity I do not know. But I like the cut of his jib.</p>
<p>It seems micro-blogging is truly being picked up by the masses. I really enjoy it, but ideally I&#8217;d love to be using a decentralised open source service, hosted on my own personal webspace. I&#8217;d like to suggest the Open Micro Blogging service, <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> as the way forward &#8211; but then I also want to be able to reply to my friends on twitter and them to me and I don&#8217;t think true two way cross network chat will happen for a while. I see <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> to <a href="http://blogger.com">blogger</a> as <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> is to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. I&#8217;m actually surprised that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a concerted effort from any one of the current big blog companies right now to push for a more open alternative. The automatticians have put out <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">prologue</a> but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been touched for over a year and only supports sharing amongst groups (as in a working environment)&#8230;that&#8217;s no fun for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Bring on a true open web status service, (complete with adopters) where I can update any one of my friends on my activities by them following a status feed on my homepage and vice versa. This requires clients who make use of such services though and right now twitter is stronger in that regard.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2008</div>

          <p>For people like myself who are fairly erratic at posting regular updates to their blogs, you might do well to pass your eyes over to <a href="http://sweetcron.com">Sweetcron</a>. Sweetcron does very well at pulling your content from other places on the web you may frequent and gathering it altogether in a neat little summary page automatically. This is otherwise known as a lifestream and has gained popularity as people tend toward exposing more of their activities on the web. You can see mine over <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/stream">here</a> (although is mostly twitter updates for the minute).</p>
<p>What sets this lifestream software apart from others is that as its opensource it can be downloaded, modified and hosted upon your own servers. That means you&#8217;re free to mess about with it as you like and maybe customise the page in your own snazzy design. It&#8217;s also based on the lovely codeigniter PHP framework from the peeps at ellislabs, which I&#8217;ve used a number of times now. You&#8217;ll need to modify the .htaccess and codeigniter config to get it working in a sub-folder, but it&#8217;s all fairly easy and self explanatory. </p>
<p>The author, <a href="http://www.yongfook.com">Yong Fook</a> has done well to put this out as a side project all on his tod. Whilst my design looks fairly basic, there is a more fancy version included that looks a lot like Yongs homepage.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a proper geek, a <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1202">homebrewed version of a lifestream</a> might be more your style.</p>
