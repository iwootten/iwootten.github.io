<div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2007</div>
	<p>I&#8217;ve heard a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/would_you_share_your_search_history.php">couple</a> of <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-facebook-app.html">rumours</a> this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&#8217;s some discussion over on <a href="http://facereviews.com/2007/08/28/google-facebook-application-a-hoax/">facereviews.com</a> that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &#8220;social networks&#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for? Probably not at all &#8211; I don&#8217;t want everyone to be clued in to all those random tee sites I&#8217;m able to find. Probably nobody would really be interested, so whats the point anyway?</p>

<p>It also brings to mind an idea that I&#8217;ve been toying with for sharing how links between pages are made, where details of hyperlink clicks are captured to some repository somewhere. This would make it it possible for users to have a series of heatmaps upon any page to display details of common links that other users choose to follow from one page to another, and common routes accross the net to particular pages. Similar issues for whether or not takeup would occur, or the information is indeed useful to everyone exist also.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2007/04/12/joost-beta">Joost Beta</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">12 Apr 2007</div>
	<p>This afternoon I was quite chuffed to discover that I&#8217;d been selected for a Joost beta invite. Joost is, in a nutshell, TV for the web . Kind of the opposite to that Current TV channel on Virgin Media. I&#8217;ve been playing with it this evening, mainly perusing the XL-Recordings and gaming channels.It all seems very good &#8211; a good seelction of channels (for me) straight off, with the ability to search Joost&#8217;s catalog of channels and add more to your collection. The interface (see shots below) is pretty swish and the advertising between shows (The maximum I endured was 2 * 10 second clips) does not detract from the channel content too much. Presumeably these are targeted advertisements, though it didn&#8217;t seem so from the few I watched. There is also the ability to interact in channels and a widget interface. I must point out that Joost is a legal service &#8211; I&#8217;m not in the business of pirating. It uses P2P (peer-to-peer), to distribute content to users &#8211; I had hardly any lags on my measly 2MB connection, although the full-screen content is compressed at quite a low bit rate.Apparently, the Mac version of joost works with the Apple remote, which I could see would make this a very pleasant experience. I think I&#8217;ll be playing with this toy a fair few more times this week.<a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.JPG" title="Joost"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Joost" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.JPG" title="joostinterface2.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface2.JPG" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.JPG" title="joostinterface3.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface3.JPG" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.JPG" title="joostinterface4.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface4.JPG" /></a></p>

I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis <a href="http://jakeandshondi.com/index/35/The_new_addition">recent announcement</a>. Anyway, it looks wicked – its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</p>

In their own words:<em>“If you are tired of seeing everyone else with the hottest friends and want some hotties of your own, then this is the place for you.”</em>For the princely sum of $1.99 – or $0.99 as an introductory offer, you can purchase a friend to leave you two comments on your profile per week. The photo’s seem to all rather fake, as their name would suggest.I would give you some more stats, but it seems that fakeyourspace is either suffering from the mashable effect (being mashed?), or indeed that its been pulled for being completely and utterly ridiculous. I wouldn’t be surprised if myspace or facebook had been on their backs in order to cut the kind of fake networking that such a system would introduce. They could easily kill each of the profiles which had been created on any of their networks if not.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2006/12/01/does-threadless-rule-or-not">Does Threadless rule or not?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">01 Dec 2006</div>
	<p><a href="http://www.threadless.com/?streetteam=scrumpyjack"><img src="http://www.threadless.com/scrap/myspace/lovethreadless.gif" border="0" /></a>Last night I perused a number of articles describing the success of my favourite t-shirt store <a href="http://threadless.com">threadless</a>, the first of which – over at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/68-7-reasons-why-threadless-rules">37Signals</a> reviews in a positive light and the <a href="http://www.hiphipuk.co.uk/2006/11/07/7-reasons-why-threadless-dont-rule-as-much-as-they-used-too/">second in a more negative one</a>.<a href="http://threadless.com">Threadless</a> is a t-shirt company with a difference, it’s a 24-7 competition allow you to become the designer. Designs are chosen by the team, and are able to be rated by the community that operates around the website.For anyone who knows me, they’ll know I love threadless tees – I believe I’m on my 4th one this week, and I have more in the post. I even got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/256308445/">engaged in one of their t-shirts</a>, although it was possibly the most highly innappropriate one to do it in.<center>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imw/256308445/" title="Engaged"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/79/256308445_df791e697c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CIMG7458.JPG" /></a>
</center>I </p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/255906494/">visited</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/255906648/">them</a> when as I was about in Chicago, though I think they probably thought I was a bit of an English loon. I find their designs original and amusing but it seems that those who kicked off the site are kicking back with some negative comments on what the sites community now represents. It shook me a bit that not everyone is as overly enthusiastic with them as I.<center>

</center>+’s:(from 37Signals) </p>

<p><strong>They’re playful</strong> – I have to say that this is one of the aspects I find most appealing, just the sheer comedy value to be found in not only their shirt designs, but the website (including many videos of daily threadless life), their emails, their attitude to the popularity. It’s great, it makes people feel good.<strong>It’s driven by community</strong> – This is what makes any web app successful but it seems threadless have been at it from day one and done a really good job at integrating it into their site. 37Signals points out the fact that participation is equal (though is visually far larger on their design), to the main consumer reason for visiting the site. When I was about to head out to Chicago, I contacted threadless as a customer to query the length of time it was taking to get an order out to me, and cheekily asked if they had any recommendations for places to visit while I was out there. Brianne, their customer service lass, replied with a huge description of what there was to do in the area, along with her personal favourites – its that kind of dedication to their community which builds them loyal customers.-’s:<strong>Bad Canvas, Second Rate Knock Offs</strong> – I don’t think their t-shirts are bad quality! Blimey, they’re only $10 half the time! Seriously, the printing quality claims and ‘feel’ of the shirts used are all a bit unfounded I think and more likely the result of teens who don’t know how to execute proper household management. The second aspect there however is going to be tackled when they soon start using their <a href="http://www.threadless.com/news/88235/EXCITING_NEWS_ABOUT_THE_TEES_WE_PRINT_ON">own specially designed material</a>. I read one example of a chap complaining of bad quality, who then went on to say he’d purchased a bunch more – surely they can’t be all that bad to warrant further purchases? As for second rate knock offs, I can’t say that I know the design community inside out, but I know I’ve never seen any of the designs anywhere else, and thats half the reason I love them.<strong>It’s myspace with t-shirts</strong> – Ah, yes, I feel your pain. Although I love what I can get out of threadless with a passion (i.e tees), I certainly despise myspace with a huge amount of disgust. I’ve previously blogged about the fact that <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/11/13/do-web-users-want-web-standards/">myspace</a> needs to sort out its web standards, I also have a certain distaste for the types of people who hang out in such virtual communities, with nothing better to do. If threadless is the t-shirt equivalent of myspace, they’ve got two aspects right (t-shirts, web standards), but then nothing can alter the types of people that hang out there, at least not this instant. I think these types are always going to be of a certain nature. I’m oblivious to these users, as I’m not actively contributing in this manner, I’m just the consumer, so what does that really matter to me? Of course it would be embarrasing to meet said teens in my university class wearing the same shirts, but I’m in the uk and I haven’t seen many people with threadless this side of the country. In fact, I’ve only ever seen them in Chicago (go figure!), and Singapore.Anyway, I still assert that I love threadless, despite other opinions and people will still be getting shirts as presents over christmas. I may however, try to attempt getting tees from other equally good shirt sites, for fear of wearing clothing resembling my students.For those of who appreciate them also, check out this image of how one of their employees, charlie will soon be working daily:<center>

</center>That’s just pure quality.</p>

	<h1><a href="/2006/11/13/do-web-users-want-web-standards">Do Web Users Want Web Standards?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">13 Nov 2006</div>
	<p>I was thinking about this earlier and was trying to make an educated answer. What I would note is that it is primarily content which drives users to use sites, we can see that through all manner of feeds and low bandwidth sites across the net. Without content, theres no point in sticking up a website. You can see demonstrations of that assertion here from time to time. It’s also fairly visible through all manner of seedy content on the web as users will be quite happy to sit through the many pop-ups and poorly formatted text to get to that bunch of images which they’re after.Design ends up just being the icing on the cake for users, but for other (perhaps) more hardcore users such as any number of programmers, it can be an ultimate turn off to see the horrendous environment which content which we thought we might be interested in is displayed.I think the reason I’ve been pondering this is the huge amount of extremely popular social networking sites which I’ve accessed which just don’t seem to abide by the rules which those of us who have been programming on the web have become accustomed to adhering to. I am of course referring to <a href="http://webstandards.org">web standards</a> and their apparent lack of appearance at <a href="http://myspace.com">myspace</a>. They’ve recently risen to light (as if they ever went away) as <a href="http://myspace.com">myspace</a> have been in talks with O2 about the <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/11/13/myspace-in-talks-with-uk-mobile-networks/">possibilities of accessing pages via mobile</a>. How can they get away by flouting design rules? Have we been lied to? Should we never have bothered? It’s kind of a joke that an application so recently on the scene is so buggy.I for one feel accomplished at the end of the day knowing that whatever I’ve produced is beautiful code (or at least my best attempt at it). It’s going to work well, and hopefully for a long time if standards are adhered to by browsers in the future too. It doesn’t need <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/08/14/browster-20-makes-myspace-easier-to-use/">other applications</a> to make it navigable either. Despite all its buggy pages though, <a href="http://myspace.com">myspace</a> must be good at something, right? It’s not just all for the kids? It’s allowed people and artists to listen to full tracks by one another and browse for similar music via those peoples friends. Oh what? – That’s it?A recent perusal through a free music mag “salvo” from my local fopp shows that out of the 10 up-and-coming artists listed, none are without a myspace page, and none offer any other point of contact. It’s kinda nice when communication is provided like this to those who want/need it, but for my part I’d much prefer if they had a wordpress blog sat on their own domain, or at least used <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a>.</p>
