      <div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2007</div>

          <p>Wow, Apple have released a new touch version of the iPod (think the iPhone with no phone) as well as updating the classic iPod (160Gb!) and new nano versions. This actually means I&#8217;d be able to have an iPod which fits my entire music collection upon it with room to spare. I&#8217;ve waited a long time for that. The iPod touch also allows wireless browsing and download of new music via iTunes. Nano versions now rock up in both 4Gb standard and 8Gb models. I&#8217;m sure someone in our department will have one before long&#8230;.</p>

          <p>Thought I&#8217;d just point out that apple uk are touting the new ipod shuffle today. Basically they have launched a bunch of extra colours, with no change to size or capacity, but they do look rather pretty. <center>

      <div class="author_meta">03 Nov 2006</div>

          <p>Our front room is looking a bit of a technology graveyard at the moment. Not only do we have the two archaic computers which have been there since forever, but now we also sport an unused fridge which has been replaced by one of our housemates parents (much larger) hand-me-downs.</p>
<p>This time last year saw the cleaning out of the Cardiff Department of Computer Science&#8217;s cupboards, with a large amount of the machines having to be &#8220;properly disposed of&#8221;, due to their burden of having huge crt monitors from yesteryear. Presumeably this means they are taken to be properly disassembled and resused if possible &#8211; somewhere like <a href="http://www.wastechnique.com/">wastechnique</a> in wales for example. When it was suggested that they be offered to charities who would re-use the machines sent to third world countries and the like, the idea was rejected because the scheme had never been attempted before.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite crazy how disposable technology has become in modern life. I suppose I notice it more now due to having that much more of it myself, I have 3 past mobile phones in my possession currently, not counting those back in Yeovil. I wonder what little gadgets we&#8217;ll be chucking out 10, 20 years down the line&#8230;..</p>

      <div class="author_meta">13 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>A couple of weeks back I discovered a slug in cash converters. Well, a usb2 external disk to nas drive converter affectionately known as the slug. Seeing as how I&#8217;ve been considering purchasing one, I figured shelling out the £25 was worth it for an experiment with <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org">installing linux</a> on it for a bit. The D-Link nslu2 features two usb2 connection points for hooking up usb2 drives, but I didn&#8217;t really feel like sacrificing my university external box as this usually comes in quite useful.Enter an icy box, one of the new sata ones, to encompass a normal hard drive &#8211; which fitted in quite well with the sata drive I purchased for my machine at uni, but never actually ended up using. In total i spent about £90 on the lot I think.I decided to get on with moving everything onto it yesterday, and first off was the 75Gb mp3 collection &#8211; taking a total of about 4 hours&#8230;. Next&#8217;ll be the 10Gb downloads directory (which I could probably do with emptying really).If I ever get round to installing linux (as it sounds a little bit of an arse) upon the slug, it could be quite sweet to set it up with <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_features.html">slim server</a> to finally have a completely silent mp3 stream in my house&#8230;..of course, this also would require investing in a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_overview.html">squeezebox</a>, or something similar.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2006/08/12/more-ubuntu-ati-9600-and-sblive">More Ubuntu? - ATI 9600 and SBLive</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">12 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>Another post about ubuntu? Where will it end?I was fairly excited from thursday evenings antics of getting things working on my machine at home, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try with my dev machine at uni. My graphics card, a 9600 (yes ATI, I know!) had been screwed since the day I&#8217;d put on Dapper, and to be honest, as I&#8217;m not using it that much for GL stuff, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered about it. After installing the ATI drivers, them not working and reinstalling the fglrx xorg drivers, I managed to get it working nicely within about 30 mins. <a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide" title="Unofficial ATI Linux Driver Wiki">This wiki page</a> may help if you&#8217;re experiencing similar problems. In my case, my driver was loading, but I was having a problem with libdri.a menaing 3d acceleration got switched off. Anyway, glxgears is now shuvving out a good 3000+ fps so I&#8217;m happy enough with that.Aha, I thought, I&#8217;ll give the soundcard a bash &#8211; a 6 year old SBLive Platinum complete with live drive. Although this (with some tweaking in alsamixer) give outputs on the pci card, the front bay wasn&#8217;t getting any output to the headphone socket. I tried to install and compile the latest emu10k drivers from <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/" title="Advanced Linux Sound Architecture">alsa</a>, but then everything got screwed up and no drivers were loading. I removed them and reinstalled what I had before. I carried on with my troubles, inspecting my front bay for any connection problems, notcing one fairly major one&#8230;..having the headphones in the mic input &#8211; doh! I&#8217;d do well to check the obvious things first in the future.</p>
