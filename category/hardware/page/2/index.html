          <p>It seems I may have spoken too soon about my linux joys with ubuntu. After performing a dist-upgrade on my previous beta version of Dapper, I discovered I&#8217;d have to go through the same problems of downloading kernel source and linux header packages for my new kernel version.I also discovered after doing this that actually there were further problems on booting Dapper straight up. Apparently the pointers to drives get screwed up somewhere in the process. Although I could boot into X using just the safety mode and booting from there, this wasn&#8217;t ideal and I still wanted my lovely little 64 bit install to be working nicely. I dicovered that adding the line ide=nodma to the line of the reference in grub solved the problem.So I&#8217;m in, great you might think, but oh no &#8211; lets try amarok on for size too&#8230; Amarok (A shiny linux media player I discoved) wasn&#8217;t playing any of my mp3&#8242;s at all, just whizzing through the lot of them. A short search revealed that in using the xine engine, xine needed further codecs to be installed to get sound out too. You&#8217;d think that a dependency would be put in place here to sort this out by default. One nice feature I like is the inbuilt submission to last.fm, a great idea in my book &#8211; I use it all the time.Anyway, <em>now </em>my Ubuntu is being nice. Oh no, have I just jinxed it?</p>

          <p>FInally, after a grand total of 10 months, I have a 64bit version of Ubuntu Linux working upon my home machine.This is great news, not only does it mean that I have a wonderful OS to try out for size, but that I can easily convert my subversion server code and latex source to my machine.As I&#8217;ve never mentioned it before, I&#8217;ll detail what the problem was here. First up, the graphics card didn&#8217;t have drivers which were working which meant that my X800 was pretty pathetic to be quite honest with you. There was a fairly simple solution through apt, which would have been nice if&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;the network card on my A8N-VM CSM was working properly, which it wasn&#8217;t, due to use of an NFORCE chipset. A build of some drivers were neccessary, which required adding a load of packages (simple if apt were working!).Anyway, several days of man hours later, and this ubuntu thing works wonderfully. If you&#8217;re having similar troubles with this board, its probably best to use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvNetInstallation" title="Ubuntu NVNet installation">this page</a> for guidance.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">09 Feb 2006</div>

          <p>For those of you who would like to have a stable SFF machine, lest ye take heed of my advice&#8230;do not buy MSI.I bought a mATX MSI RS480M2-IL back in october, with a view to putting it in my new Antec Aria SFF case. It looked deceptively feature packed with its 939 madness and 3 x PCI and PCI-E slots. There it still currently resides sitting quietly all day until I return from work in the evening to perhaps do a little web design or listen to the 70 odd gigs of music I have stashed away. A simple task you might think, but not for MSI, it justs freezes when you least expect it.No amount of BIOS updates or re-configuring of internal cabling will remedy this, instability is an added feature of MSI boards. The best part is, it only crashes during normal windows usage, not hardcore gaming &#8211; bizarre&#8230;.It&#8217;s in all honesty the first board I&#8217;m thinking of ditching with another and just plain rubbish.</p>
