      <div class="author_meta">13 Jan 2009</div>

          <p>It seems that all I do these days is talk about what&#8217;s going on over at <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and if you&#8217;re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I&#8217;ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what&#8217;s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re holding our <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com/challenge/fairytales">second design challenge</a> right now and calling for designs based around the concept of a unique twist on a fairy tale. The prize is our biggest ever, at £200 + a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS3 (which was kindly donated by one of F&#038;B&#8217;s community!). You have until 15th February to both submit a design and get it voted on by the F&#038;B peeps!</p>
<p>It looks like I&#8217;ve also failed to mention over here the winner of our Snowdodgers competition as the amazing <a href="http://www.mistershrew.co.uk">Mister Shrew</a>. The shirts we printed look amazing and you should pick one up now if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2008</div>

          <p>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I&#8217;m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with <a href="http://fairdos.com">fairdos</a> and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don&#8217;t appeal to us at all. Some of these friends are people who are right up there within prominent fairtrade companies, who although avid promoters, won&#8217;t wear fairtrade on a day to day basis if it means they have to sacrifice their style. It seems that the fairtrade companies don&#8217;t do design and so we&#8217;re not given a choice between two similar products. The end result is we&#8217;re faced with looking great and feeling a little discontent that the garment isn&#8217;t as fantastic as it could be, or feeling great about a product &#8211; but not looking so awesome. We&#8217;ve often spoken of beginning a fairtrade company that puts out clothing that is both ethically produced and well designed, but held off doing so because it felt a little beyond us. I can say here now that we&#8217;ve made the first step in bringing that vision a little closer.</p>
<p><a href="http://fairandbare.com">Fair and Bare</a> is a crowdsourcing project which pays out comission to designers who successfully produce t shirt design ideas for fairtrade t shirts. It&#8217;s also an attempt for the fairtrade community to lose that somewhat &#8216;serious face&#8217; with which I think they are often associated and relax the shoulders a bit whilst having some fun. We&#8217;re currently offering £200 for designs and £50 for design ideas which we think are worth printing up onto fairtrade cotton. We then hope to offer shirts at a somewhat more accessible price than other fairtrade shirts. It&#8217;s a fun, small project at the moment, but I hope that we can help rejuvinate an otherwise awesome product and maybe inspire others to do the same.</p>
