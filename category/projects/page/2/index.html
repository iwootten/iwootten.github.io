          <p>Just realised that my cms doesn&#8217;t display properly in IE6. Might explain why it looked so dodgy at my mid-year meeting with my supervisor.</p>
<p>Got a few extra things in my project, permission system is fully functional, priorities for roles, workflow management &#8211; all of which still have bugs. Going to get down to the actual &#8220;management&#8221; part of the CMS tomorrow.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">01 Feb 2004</div>

          <p>What a waste of a day that was&#8230;I hate programming. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent most of the day stuck on trivial little tasks like trying to pass back multi-dimensional arrays through scripts, and interpret the results.</p>
<p>On an upside, I&#8217;ve managed to get XSL producing XHTML output and generated a working grid for the actions in the system. I also found a bug in XSL which means that it will condense textarea tags to their smallest form, and resulting in incorrect display in most web browsers.</p>

          <p>After spending most of the day working upon it, I have managed to convert the whole template system in my project over to XML. I also added the beginnings of a permissions system which has no functionality yet. </p>
<p>This does need some time for me to go through the motions of Spec, Design, Implementation write-up for this over the weekend so that I can present it next week during my mid-year progress presentation with my project supervisor.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">28 Jan 2004</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve spent a large portion of today converting bits of my project over to using XML with XSLT stylesheets. This solves a few issues that I&#8217;d had problems with.</p>
<ol>
<li>Generating RSS feeds.  </li>
<li>The masses of files for each template is now reduced to a single XSLT file, easily modified by anyone knowing what they are doing.  </li>
<li>Better compliance with web standards (missing &#8220;&#8216;s, closing tags all need to be corrected) means that it should be relatively XHTML compliant when tested.  </li>
<li>Well layed out source.</li>
</ol>
<p>I haven&#8217;t completely finished moving over to this new format but will try and sort it all by the end of tommorow.</p>

          <p>After having been working like theres no tomorrow on other coursework, I&#8217;ve finally managed to come back to my project work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really not got very much productive work done on it aside from a few class diagrams and workflow routines which I&#8217;ve put together. I have been working on a prototype over the last month however in order to have that side of things produced on time. Currently it doesn&#8217;t do a lot more than add or delete users and needs to come a lot further before its something impressive which is worthy to be shown to my supervisor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spending this next week in producing the documents which I really should of put together a long time ago. I&#8217;ll have to hang around up here until the end of the week I think. I had made a start at writing the requirements spec but it was nothing more than a draft really.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will of finalised everything by the end of the week so I can have a more enjoyable christmas at home.</p>
