          <p>This month, I&#8217;ve decided to take some time out to ship projects. </p>
<p>I have a huge list of projects accumulating I&#8217;d like to push out of the door, but as a father and freelancer I have lack of a certain commodity in able to achieve them. That would be time.</p>
<p>Currently I don&#8217;t have any work booked in for a while, so along with Viv, we&#8217;ve decided I should try and get some of these projects released. </p>
<p>That sounds easy, but I&#8217;m well aware from past experience it isn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t want to work outside of working hours (9-5.30pm) as I know the impact it has on my family. My hope is by setting myself some achievable goals I can at least get some way to ticking off some checkboxes on this growing todo list. </p>
<p>Some of these projects are products I&#8217;ve not yet completed, projects I&#8217;ve released but need work or ideas that haven&#8217;t made it to the build stage yet. As a freelancer, I hope that some of them may even help out other people in a similar situation to me.</p>
<p>Over the coming month, I&#8217;m going to attempt to ship at least 4 projects out of the door. 1 a week for 4 weeks. I&#8217;ll be blogging about my progress here, and posting summaries of how it went at the end of each week. The end date of the 28th is also my birthday, so it would be great present to myself to have come some way to meeting my goal.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. </p>

<p>We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released. <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Head over to buy one (or more!)</a>.</p>

          <p>If anyone else like me is considering working in the uk &#8220;web 2.0&#8243; market, and finds the posts on common job boards clogged up with all the jobs from america, the small job board I have created and posted online might be a help. You&#8217;ll find it over at: <a href="http://webtyrant.com/jobs">http://webtyrant.com/jobs</a>. It aggregates some common job boards together like 37Signals and ThinkVitamin, but removes anything but those located in the UK.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve started a new blog over at <a href="http://www.webtyrant.com">webtyrant.com</a> for all of you who visit my site and need a fix of techie-type jazz. I figured most of you didn&#8217;t, hence my placement on a different domain. You might notice a similar theme over there, so that&#8217;ll make you feel right at home even if the content doesn&#8217;t.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m realling struggling at the moment to get a visual interface all sorted and loverly so people can literally &#8220;point-and-click&#8221;. I made the decision to do this after talks with both my supervisor and moderator and have been trying like crazy to get it sorted, its taken over a week so far! Not good.</p>
<p>My moderator also suggested that trying to find example XML schemas for CMS&#8217;s which were already out on the market at the moment for would make for good reading also.</p>
<p>I have to go see my supervisor this week anyway, will post to say how it went.</p>
