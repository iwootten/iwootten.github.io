		   <p>Tonight, Cineworld gave us tickets free to any film of our choice when we were meant to be seeing a preview, due to a cock up at their end. I already knew what it would be without looking at what was out, Hot Fuzz. </p>

<p>I’ve loved Simon Pegg ever since the days of Big Train, when humour was just so completely random it had to be funny. Shaun of the Dead had some great random moments in it, but I left it feeling that it wasn’t the best I’d come to expect. Hot Fuzz however is a great take on an altogether different genre, although you might not be able to tell from the gore levels it dishes out. Apparently it was filmed in Wells in Somerset, which actually is the smallest city in England and my home county. The uniforms they wore confused the locals who thought they were real policemen. Obviously nobody watches spoof zombie movies down there except me and a few others. If you’re looking for an action-packed bloody comedy, get down to your local cinema already.</p>
