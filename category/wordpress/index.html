      <div class="author_meta">21 Jan 2013</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve long made use of the default theme on WordPress, which I&#8217;ve always felt wasn&#8217;t entirely &#8220;me&#8221;. The theme now live is one I&#8217;ve been tinkering with for a while now based on the lovely preview design used in the <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a> document editing tool for github. I really like the focus on simplicity and think it suits me well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added some different styling for the navigation elements, given they didn&#8217;t already exist on <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>. I&#8217;ve also added some subtle colour changes when navigating between pages, many of which are based on <a href="http://laurakalbag.com">Laura Kalbag</a>&#8216;s palettes over on <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/LJK">colour lovers</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I hadn&#8217;t counted on was consolidating 10 years worth of blog posts into sensible categories as it was becoming a bit of a mess. When I first started blogging, wordpress didn&#8217;t exist, let alone tagging and I think I started out using categories in a manner to replicate them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a few things I&#8217;m not entirely happy with, such as how navigation is represented for single posts. I intend to tidy the theme up and release it back to the WordPress community, but for now I&#8217;m enjoying having finally got it out in the open. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">20 Jul 2011</div>

          <p>Just a quick note to say I&#8217;ve updated the plugin that generates my <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/filmstream">filmstream pages</a>. It&#8217;s become obvious that the <a href="http://developer.lovefilm.com">Lovefilm API</a> only exposes the last 10 features that you&#8217;ve rented in their &#8220;at home&#8221; list. This isn&#8217;t that great if you&#8217;ve been renting more than a few months. This is the same as the information you&#8217;d see in your account when logged in.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve made a simple modification to use the actual ids that <a href="http://lovefilm.com">Lovefilm</a> issue for films, rather than a autoincrement value. This way, there&#8217;s no need to empty what&#8217;s currently stored when updating and we capture the users history of rentals&#8230;</p>
<p>You can grab it over <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/filmstream.zip">here</a></p>

          <h1><a href="/2011/05/07/updating-wordpress-automatically-over-sftp">Updating WordPress Automatically over SFTP</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">07 May 2011</div>

          <p>Heres a quick how to on getting wordpress to update over SFTP. On a default install of php, wordpress only gives the option to update over FTP. I wanted to get it working as it&#8217;s more secure and means I don&#8217;t have to open up FTP on my virtual server and open another port up in the firewall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using ubuntu and the sequence of commands I followed were:</p>
<pre class="bash">sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev libssh2-php
</pre>

<p>You should now find that if you list the modules installed in php and check if ssh2 is now there, you get the result &#8220;ssh2&#8243;:</p>
<pre class="bash">php -m | grep ssh2
</pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to restart apache for the changes to begin being used.</p>
<pre class="bash">sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
</pre>

<p>If you head to updates in your dashboard, you should now see an extra option &#8220;SSH2&#8243; and spaces for public and private authentication keys. I had to head back to the terminal and create these particular files.</p>
<pre class="bash">cd ~
ssh-keygen
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 755 .ssh
chmod 644 .ssh/*
sudo chown -R ian:www-data /var/www/pathtowordpress/
</pre>

<p>Now you can head into the updates page again, enter your username and password and the locations to your public and private keys (/home/ian/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and /home/ian/.ssh/id_rsa in my case). If you&#8217;re running ssh on a non standard port, be sure to append that to your hostname. </p>

      <div class="author_meta">28 Nov 2010</div>

          <p>I think my post title says it all really. I&#8217;ve just discovered that amazon has deprecated use of its ListLookup method since October 15th. I had used this in order to retrieve details of my amazon wishlist and display neatly on my blog using <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/04/02/amazon-associates-wordpress-wishlist-plugin">my wishlist plugin</a>. Now it seems I&#8217;m forced to generate one with their own widget builder. This in turn means my wordpress plugin will no longer work. Sorry for those who were making use of it, or would like to use it. It&#8217;s also apparent that this is a kick in the teeth for developers building sites entirely dependant on this method. <a href="https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=53342">This chap estimates he made $11k in the last year using this function</a>. This is the trouble with building stuff that relies on third party services. I wonder how much more of their api they will gradually remove?</p>

      <div class="author_meta">18 Apr 2010</div>

          <p>Something I&#8217;ve thought I&#8217;d like to have on my site for a while is a list of movies that I&#8217;ve recently seen and some brief opinions on them. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I would go about this for films I see at the cinema, or whether I could muster the stamina to review every single film I&#8217;ve watched, but a recent television upgrade has now meant I&#8217;ve got the opportunity to do this.</p>
<p>Our television came with a years subscription to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">lovefilm</a>, which means I can now track our past film watching history. At four blu rays a month, that&#8217;s quite a lot of films over the course of the year.</p>
<p>Love Film have recently opened up their doors with an api and <a href="http://developer.lovefilm.com">developer area</a> (which unfortunately is not particularly active at the moment). Anyway &#8211; their documentation is pretty thorough and has made the process of creating a wordpress plugin to display my past rentals really simple. You can see some example output of it on my site <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/filmstream">over here</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab the plugin over <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/filmstream.zip">here</a>. It&#8217;s authenticated by oauth (for which you&#8217;ll require php on your blog host to be compiled with oauth enabled) and so will bounce you over to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">lovefilm</a> to ask for access to your account, but after that will update on a daily basis. Just click &#8220;Fetch Items&#8221; on the filmstream admin page and stick <code>&lt;!--filmstream_content--&gt;</code> in any page to display a table containing all your past rentals. There&#8217;s no options to speak of right now, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be extending it in the future.</p>
