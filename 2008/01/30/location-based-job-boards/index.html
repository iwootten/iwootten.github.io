    <p>One of the most frustrating things I find about hearing about possible web development jobs on certain sites is the sheer amount of them which are simply unviable due to my UK location. Previously I decided to post all those jobs I could find to my own webtyrant site and the recent <a href="http://djangogigs.com">job</a> and <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jan/23/djangopeople/">profile sites</a> in the django communities has got me thinking about how these two pieces of information on locality could be aggregated together (I don&#8217;t have time myself to do this though unfortunately &#8211; perhaps someone might like to chat about collaborating). What I&#8217;ve concluded is that being aware of those jobs within a certain area might be quite useful &#8211; and simple to implement. What you&#8217;d basically end up with is a situation where you could subscribe to updates on jobs in a particular field within a certain area (think &#8211; &#8220;tell me about all dev jobs within 50 miles&#8221;). Whilst this feature may exist on some other sites (though I&#8217;m unaware of it) my experience tells me that it probably isn&#8217;t executed particularly well.</p>
