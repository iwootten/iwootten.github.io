          <p>I&#8217;m not sure how many visitors have caught this ted talk before, but I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d post it anyway. Johnny Chung Lee is amazing, turning a $40 wii remote into use an interactive whiteboard or a new way to interact with video games via head tracking. He&#8217;s been at this sort of thing for ages previously putting out a <a href="http://www.littlegreatideas.com/steadycam/">$14 steadycam</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2008</div>

          <p>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I&#8217;m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with <a href="http://fairdos.com">fairdos</a> and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don&#8217;t appeal to us at all. Some of these friends are people who are right up there within prominent fairtrade companies, who although avid promoters, won&#8217;t wear fairtrade on a day to day basis if it means they have to sacrifice their style. It seems that the fairtrade companies don&#8217;t do design and so we&#8217;re not given a choice between two similar products. The end result is we&#8217;re faced with looking great and feeling a little discontent that the garment isn&#8217;t as fantastic as it could be, or feeling great about a product &#8211; but not looking so awesome. We&#8217;ve often spoken of beginning a fairtrade company that puts out clothing that is both ethically produced and well designed, but held off doing so because it felt a little beyond us. I can say here now that we&#8217;ve made the first step in bringing that vision a little closer.</p>
<p><a href="http://fairandbare.com">Fair and Bare</a> is a crowdsourcing project which pays out comission to designers who successfully produce t shirt design ideas for fairtrade t shirts. It&#8217;s also an attempt for the fairtrade community to lose that somewhat &#8216;serious face&#8217; with which I think they are often associated and relax the shoulders a bit whilst having some fun. We&#8217;re currently offering £200 for designs and £50 for design ideas which we think are worth printing up onto fairtrade cotton. We then hope to offer shirts at a somewhat more accessible price than other fairtrade shirts. It&#8217;s a fun, small project at the moment, but I hope that we can help rejuvinate an otherwise awesome product and maybe inspire others to do the same.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2008/04/02/amazon-associates-wordpress-wishlist-plugin">Amazon Associates WordPress Wishlist Plugin</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">02 Apr 2008</div>

          <p>One of the things that&#8217;s bugged me for a while whilst having a website is that at certain times of the year when people might actually like to buy me a gift they&#8217;re unable to find my wishlist. This is mainly because they&#8217;re simple folk who might not think to check amazon for my name. I&#8217;m also signed up with amazon associates, so I decided it could do me well to post my wishlist items along with my referral tag in the links in order to earn a bob or two on my own homepage. All this data is available on the web already its just a case of putting it together.</p>
<p>Some keen readers might of noticed the wishlist page I stuck up recently and want something similar on their own site and (like myself) either can&#8217;t be bothered or didn&#8217;t have the time to create a plugin to pull this data together. I&#8217;m putting up here my own quick and dirty plugin I built a few weeks ago to achieve this.</p>
<p>It uses amazon web services to look up a wishlist, stick in a specified associates id in each of my item links and replace where I put the text <!-- wishlist_content --> (without spaces) in a post with my wishlist items. The plugin regularly updates this (hourly) as a scheduled event in wordpress in case someone decides to actually buy me something. Of course you&#8217;ll need a services key to use it, which you can easily get by signing up with amazon at aws.amazon.com. Fill out your services id, your wishlist id (found by logging into amazon and heading to your wishlist page) and your locale (the bit after amazon. so mine is .co.uk) and press the fetch items to pull all the items in. If you don&#8217;t have an associates id, feel free to leave as my own : )</p>
<p>I used curl to get the remote data from amazon as the file_get_content methods generally aren&#8217;t enabled on normal web hosts. If you&#8217;d like the items to be fetched less regularly, then install the plugin with and updated wp_schedule_event method in the main wishlist.php to a value of your choice.</p>
<p>You can download it over <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/wishlist.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Double alliteration in a post title? Not sure I&#8217;ve attempted that before.</em></p>
<p>[Edit: You&#39;ll need to be running on PHP5 to make use of this plugin]<br>[Edit: I released an updated version based on Amazon&#39;s move to use of signitures, see the details <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/10/25/amazon-associates-wordpress-plugin-v0-2">here</a>]</p>

          <h1><a href="/2008/01/31/book-review-code-igniter-for-rapid-php-application-development">Book Review: Code Igniter for Rapid PHP Application Development</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">31 Jan 2008</div>

          <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847191746/staplediet-21"><img src="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/1847191746.02.TZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Code Igniter for Rapid PHP Application Development" /></a>In this book, author David Upton walks you through use of the Code Igniter framework, which is essentially PHP&#8217;s answer to Ruby on Rails. I&#8217;ve been a avid user of <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Code Igniter</a> since I discovered it last year, which is a nice waypoint for anyone trying to understand model-view-controller architectures and not wanting to make the move over to ROR quite yet.</p>
<p>The angle of this book is taken from a first time CI developer, but one with some knowledge of both PHP and web development in general. The initial chapters begin by exploring why you&#8217;d choose to use CI and some of its benefits over straight PHP code (such as saving on code reproduction or easing development burdens), though doesn&#8217;t really offer any real comparison of features of other similar frameworks. A traditional chapter on setup of CI is also included, (though I think at 4 pages could have perhaps been merged with another!). </p>
<p>The book then proceeds by tackling the subject at the core of CI, &#8216;model-view-controller&#8217; and how this relates to traditional methods of programming. David breaks down how CI is structured very well and gives suggestions of how applications built within it should be designed to be successful. Some of the example code savings at this stage are somewhat minimal over a standard approach, but I think David conveys how these rack up throughout a web app. Useful chapters of how active record and CRUD can be used to ease DB interaction and also how views can be organised to avoid repitition complete with examples should allow any new CI developer to get to grips with it very quickly.</p>
<p>The later chapters quite extensively cover more &#8220;geeky&#8221; complicated subjects (using objects and namespaces, localisation, getting CI to interact with other services) which might be a bit much for a hobbyist user, but it gives some room for learning for others. The book also includes some good descriptions of how to make the most of the testing and profiling features which CI has out of the box to debug some of the larger web applications that you might undertake (Both features which I&#8217;ve previously been unaware of).</p>
<p>The use of friendly language is a welcome change from other texts, but I think in places it does get in the way a bit of the particular functionality which is being talked about. The constant reenforcement of the MVC throughout will be welcome for new converts, but my own practical experience suggests this might be better bent in places. A number of the descriptions of features provided in the book are at the CI site, and I think what might have helped this book is if a single larger running example led the way to describing each of the features.</p>
<p>At the moment, this is the only CI book available and it does well at covering the large featureset CI has. For a seasoned CI veteran it won&#8217;t bring any revelations, but if you&#8217;re new the framework it will serve you extremely well at getting your head round what makes it shine.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">30 Jan 2008</div>

          <p>One of the most frustrating things I find about hearing about possible web development jobs on certain sites is the sheer amount of them which are simply unviable due to my UK location. Previously I decided to post all those jobs I could find to my own webtyrant site and the recent <a href="http://djangogigs.com">job</a> and <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2008/Jan/23/djangopeople/">profile sites</a> in the django communities has got me thinking about how these two pieces of information on locality could be aggregated together (I don&#8217;t have time myself to do this though unfortunately &#8211; perhaps someone might like to chat about collaborating). What I&#8217;ve concluded is that being aware of those jobs within a certain area might be quite useful &#8211; and simple to implement. What you&#8217;d basically end up with is a situation where you could subscribe to updates on jobs in a particular field within a certain area (think &#8211; &#8220;tell me about all dev jobs within 50 miles&#8221;). Whilst this feature may exist on some other sites (though I&#8217;m unaware of it) my experience tells me that it probably isn&#8217;t executed particularly well.</p>
