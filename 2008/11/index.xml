      <description>I&amp;#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &amp;#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. 

We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&amp;#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I announced that we&amp;#8217;re running our first design challenge in conjunction with team Snowdodgers at Fair &amp;#038; Bare. These are some really amazing fellas who are trying to raise £48,000 for charity by rallying a £200 banger round 4000 miles involving the Arctic circle. We&amp;#8217;re asking designers to get in designs relating to the chilly weather and the guys crazy antics!
If you&amp;#8217;re interested, you&amp;#8217;ve got just a month to get an entry in.</description>
