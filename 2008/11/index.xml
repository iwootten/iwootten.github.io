These are some really amazing fellas who are trying to raise £48,000 for charity by rallying a £200 banger round 4000 miles involving the Arctic circle. We’re asking designers to get in designs relating to the chilly weather and the guys crazy antics!
If you’re interested, you’ve got just a month to get an entry in.</description></item></channel></rss>
