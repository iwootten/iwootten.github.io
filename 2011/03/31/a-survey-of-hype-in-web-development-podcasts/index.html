    <p>I listen to quite a few web dev podcasts. Something that irks me about a lot of them, is how much they tend to hype their own shows, products or the like. Sure, they&#8217;re allowed to, it is their own podcast after all, often from their own businesses etc. I&#8217;m fully aware this all possibly contributes toward the success of shows, but it annoys me nonetheless.</p>

<p>One of these things is the title of the show itself. I don&#8217;t really get why its necessary to repeat the title (Sure I do really, to drum it into my head), given it&#8217;s going to be within the title of the mp3. I know what I&#8217;m listening to after all, because my favourite media player tells me.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to count the number of times a show utters it&#8217;s name over its duration. Sure, I realise this is somewhat ocd and geeky, but hey. Here&#8217;s my results for a typical set of podcasts that I often listen to in a week. I&#8217;ve linked up the data I&#8217;ve used to create this chart on <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AiyMcCUnltKwdG85QnNKMnhneUVXMjJNUzVCa0kzNEE&amp;#038;hl=en&amp;#038;pli=1&amp;#038;authkey=CJbb9a0L#gid=0">google spreadsheets</a>, for anyone else who may be interested to contribute to and build upon further. I gathered the data all myself by listening to each podcast and counting when mentions of the show were made but it may be a good excuse for me to experiment with amazon turk.</p>

<p>The big web show comes out tops with one mention over 40 mins worth of show and boagworld comes last with 24 mentions of the show over its duration. (It&#8217;s unfortunate for boagworld that its theme tune includes a voice repeating the title in the theme. I did originally include echos, which would be 34 mentions, but my colleagues inform me this may be taking the experiment a little too far :))</p>

<p>I plan to do the same for product mentions (adverts I guess) in a weeks worth of (different) episodes, but if anyone wants to go ahead and update with their own findings that would be great.</p>
