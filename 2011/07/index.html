<div class="author_meta">20 Jul 2011</div>
<p>Just a quick note to say I’ve updated the plugin that generates my <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/filmstream">filmstream pages</a>. It’s become obvious that the <a href="http://developer.lovefilm.com">Lovefilm API</a> only exposes the last 10 features that you’ve rented in their “at home” list. This isn’t that great if you’ve been renting more than a few months. This is the same as the information you’d see in your account when logged in.</p>

<p>I’ve made a simple modification to use the actual ids that <a href="http://lovefilm.com">Lovefilm</a> issue for films, rather than a autoincrement value. This way, there’s no need to empty what’s currently stored when updating and we capture the users history of rentals…</p>

<p>You can grab it over <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/filmstream.zip">here</a></p>

<div class="author_meta">14 Jul 2011</div>
<p>Last week, tickets went on sale for dConstruct 2011 and sold out within an impressive 7 hours. Having attended in 2010 and 2008 and judging it to be filled with the highest calibre web celebs from across the globe, I coughed up the entrance fee as part of the excited gold-rush. The cost of £150 includes access to the pre and after parties and the conference itself.</p>

<p>These type of events are stuffed to the brim with amazing, intelligent web professionals, many of whom I would consider to be colleagues. I’ve followed their progress, listened to them speak, bought their publications and hacked on code with them at many other previous events.</p>

<p>It’s often quoted within tech circles that the best parts of these events are not the talks themselves, but the networking parties that surround them. I really struggle in these environments, nervously trying to find a crowd I feel comfortable chatting with, introducing myself and trying to strike up some cutting edge debate on the topics of the day. I’m a developer who usually lurks behind a computer screen for 8 hours a day, so why wouldn’t I find it awkward? It feels like uncharted territory every time I find myself there. Although meeting some great, interesting people, I have ultimately never forged any new lasting relations in this way, where the interaction is somewhat forced and artificial. Maybe it’s just me, but given the com mon nature of everyones work, you’d think it might be easier. As a friend once observed – it’s like everyone turns up to sell their product, but there are no buyers.</p>

<p>It’s also great to be able to chat within the inner circle of the celebrities who attend. You’ve heard from them all year round and now have a brief opportunity to chat. I guess really I’d love to bounce questions and thoughts off of these guys all evening, but often I get the feeling I’m being evaluated against the rest of the attendees in the room in terms of worthiness. Until you’re edging<br />
into such circles yourself, I’m not entirely sure what they would get from these conversations either.</p>

<p>In fact, what I have found is that my most fruitful and long lasting relations have been founded at events when in a participatory nature. Most of these have been Hack Days (where you’re invited to quickly hack together software as an exemplar of new apis from a number of vendors) and some of them have been at Bar Camps (where all attendees have to speak on a subject close to their heart). I feel closer to these people than I could ever do with someone I spoke with briefly in a noisy bar. I’ll also remember faces and names of people even if I never had the chance to interact with them.</p>

<p>This year, a new variety of geek meet has arisen, which flip these more traditional events on their heads and instead focus on providing environments that focus on “the best bits”. They allow everyone to participate on level pegging rather than follow a traditional conference structure. Earlier this month there was &lt;a href=“http://geekkart.in”&gt;Geek Karting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=“http://insitestour.com”&gt;The Insites Tour&lt;/a&gt; is kicking off next week and later this year there’s &lt;a href=“http://preparetoactivate.com”&gt;Activate&lt;/a&gt;. I really like the idea of these as a way of sparking interesting relationships and I’m hopefully going to head to Insites next week to see what Elliot and Keir have been able to cook up. I’d hope to see more of these unusual types of event and ultimately participate in more of them.</p>

<p>I still feel that conferences have their place, otherwise I wouldn’t have coughed up the fee for dConstruct. I enjoy hearing what these illustrious speakers have to say. That part of the event is still important for sparking debate and learning from for months and years afterward. However, I just don’t find surrounding parties as valuable to me as I first would have thought.</p>

<h1><a href="/2011/07/04/maintaining-references-to-sockets-with-express-and-socket-io">Maintaining References to Sockets with Express and Socket.io</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">04 Jul 2011</div>
<p>I hit a frustrating problem when trying to use expressjs alongside <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> recently. The solution may seem somewhat trivial, but I struggled with it for a while, until finally asking for help on the <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> irc channel. I’m not sure if a better solution exists for my case, but this is what I have for now.</p>

<p>In the main route of my express app, I needed to iterate across an array, performing a REST call using each element as a parameter and spit the results back for socket.io to send out to the browser. To get some idea of what that would look like, imagine the following.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">someArray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
   <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someVariable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">results</span><span class="p">){</span>
     <span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;msg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">results</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>My problem then became, how do I emit in this way, given my use case? All examples I could find on the <a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> homepages demonstrate emitting msgs on connection, like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sockets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;connection&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="c1">// send custom events to browser socket</span>
  <span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;hi&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="s1">&#39;i can send&#39;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;json!&#39;</span> <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But I wanted to emit messages as part of a loop, within an app route. How would I do that? I could wrap the loop with the connection logic:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sockets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;connection&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">someArray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
      <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someVariable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">results</span><span class="p">){</span>
         <span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;msg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">results</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>But if I do this, then my connection listener would be added on every refresh of the route. This would mean I’d end up with duplicate binding of event listeners and a load more results messages would be emitted than I’d expect. This would result in crazy behavior for any user who might choose to refresh your app.</p>

<p>Actually, the solution is rather simple although not entirely obvious given the nature of using node. If you maintain a reference to the socket as a global variable and then later emit upon that same socket, like so:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">global_socket</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">io</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sockets</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;connection&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">global_socket</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">socket</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">){</span>
  <span class="k">for</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="nx">lt</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">someArray</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">someVariable</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">doSomething</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">err</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">results</span><span class="p">){</span>
      <span class="nx">global_socket</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;msg&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">results</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>This way, a connection will be established and maintained and we won’t get duplicate bindings when refreshing the route of the app. Simple when you know how. I had a rather interesting discussion following this on irc about whether the use of express and socket.io together is warranted, given that socket.io supports use of variable passing and ultimately could entirely replace an express app.</p>
