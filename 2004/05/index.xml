      <description>In order to give a little more items of interest here, these are a few of the images which I&amp;#8217;ve been creating to assist me with my Image Processing module here at Cardiff&amp;#8230;
Basically, an image of a Chicken Breast is taken, and the best approximation to a cardioid found and displayed. This involves taking an image, performing Median filtering upon it to remove noise, edge detecting it with sobel masks, forming an accumulator space from the approximate gradient determined, and finally locating the largest peak within this space&amp;#8230;.</description>

      <description>Hmm, haven&amp;#8217;t really written much here in a while. Things are going ok, I have my final 4 exams over the next fortnight which I&amp;#8217;m currently struggling revising for. Will hopefully pull out the grades I want, but I&amp;#8217;m cutting it fine..
I&amp;#8217;ve also finished my project, and its up and running on the web at www.understroke.com (requires client side XSL processing, IE 6+ Mozilla 1.4+).
Anyway, thats all I have to say for now, I&amp;#8217;m off to watch Kill Bill 2.</description>
