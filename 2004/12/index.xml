      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve got rid of the old phpautogallery that I had and dumped simple php gallery up instead. I&amp;#8217;ve also converted shedloads of photos over so that peeps can see what I&amp;#8217;ve been up to recently and not so recently. This includes most of the weddings I&amp;#8217;ve attended over the last few years of very close friends, plus a few random ones for good measure.
Check them all out here http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Wootten/gallery</description>

      <description>Can it be December already? What have I been doing? Wheres the last 3 months gone? I have to say I feel more Christmas-sy this year in Cardiff than I have ever been up here.
There seems to have been a bit of a build up so far.. Watching &amp;#8220;Bad Santa&amp;#8221; back in Nov (quite possibly the most amount of swearing I&amp;#8217;ve ever seen in a film), going to Germany the other week with all the festive fun over there.</description>
