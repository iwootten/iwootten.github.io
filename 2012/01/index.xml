      <description>Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for New Adventures 2012. I&amp;#8217;d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand.
I&amp;#8217;ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn&amp;#8217;t miss a thing.</description>

      <description>I just sent the following email to 1 &amp;#038; 1&amp;#8242;s billing department. I&amp;#8217;ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.
As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.</description>
