    <p>I just sent the following email to 1 � 1′s billing department. I’ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.</p>
<p>As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We contacted you regarding a declined payment or an expired credit/debit card and have not yet heard back from you.<br>
Our records indicate that there is an unpaid balance in your 1�1 customer account no.: K####### as listed below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly – No you didn’t.</p>
<p>Secondly – It would be far more useful telling me which domain name in my account a payment demand is in reference to rather than my account number, as I have more than 1 domain with you.</p>
<p>Thirdly – The steps you’ve listed here to find my payment details miss steps and references links that don’t exist.</p>
<p>Fourthly – Threatening action when you haven’t actually sent a primary payment request email is rude, forceful and obnoxious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please be aware that if this matter is not resolved, you may be sent to a debt collection agency. If the account is sent to a debt collection agency a £15.00 &gt; charge will be added to the unpaid balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’ve decided to take all of my business elsewhere at the earliest opportunity. I’d hope you’d take heed of these comments and pay your other longstanding customers the respect they deserve.</p>
