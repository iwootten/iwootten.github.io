      <div class="author_meta">23 Jan 2012</div>

          <p>Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for <a href="http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures 2012</a>. I&#8217;d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn&#8217;t miss a thing.</p>
<p>Colly and his team had done a lovely job of organising enough to keep us busy what with bowling, screenprinting, fr00tball, the after party and of course the main event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small.jpg"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="The Albert Hall" width="640" height="480" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515" /></a></p>
<p>Despite not actually branding myself as a web designer, it was great to feel welcomed and able to chat one on one with others about our day to day work. Dan Mall&#8217;s talked helped somewhat here, forcing introductions with everyone around me. I&#8217;m pretty much work in solitary confinement as a developer and to discuss the thoughts and ideas I have with other like minded creatives is always welcome.</p>
<p>During a dinner following the conference, another dev commented that the most of the presentations weren&#8217;t specific to web design. They were in fact so abstract, that it was more a &#8220;Self Help Class for Web Designers&#8221;. I pretty much agree with this. But that&#8217;s with a caveat &#8211; what else do you attend these presentations for? NA Conf is there to share, inspire and enable designers to be better designers. I want to leave giddy eyed with possibilities. Remember there are workshops too for specifics&#8230;</p>
<p>After the whole conference, I feel like there&#8217;s a whole lot more I could do to better myself at my craft. Hopefully over the course of the year I&#8217;ll do something about it. Most of the notes I made are to this effect too and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll take away something different each time I look at them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only so much that can be covered in 45 mins, and for me I want to see a speaker paint me the big picture. After NAConf, I&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of big pictures to get through.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">12 Jan 2012</div>

          <p>I just sent the following email to 1 &#038; 1&#8242;s billing department. I&#8217;ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.</p>
<p>As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We contacted you regarding a declined payment or an expired credit/debit card and have not yet heard back from you.<br>Our records indicate that there is an unpaid balance in your 1&#038;1 customer account no.: K####### as listed below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly &#8211; No you didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Secondly &#8211; It would be far more useful telling me which domain name in my account a payment demand is in reference to rather than my account number, as I have more than 1 domain with you.</p>
<p>Thirdly &#8211; The steps you&#8217;ve listed here to find my payment details miss steps and references links that don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Fourthly &#8211; Threatening action when you haven&#8217;t actually sent a primary payment request email is rude, forceful and obnoxious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please be aware that if this matter is not resolved, you may be sent to a debt collection agency. If the account is sent to a debt collection agency a Â£15.00 &gt; charge will be added to the unpaid balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to take all of my business elsewhere at the earliest opportunity. I&#8217;d hope you&#8217;d take heed of these comments and pay your other longstanding customers the respect they deserve.</p>
