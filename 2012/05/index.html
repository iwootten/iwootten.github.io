          <p>If my years in academia have taught me anything, it&#8217;s that insight obvious to you isn&#8217;t often obvious to others. </p>
<p>As a result, I&#8217;ve pretty much adopted a gung-ho hacker attitude towards getting my own ideas built whereby I&#8217;ll just often work to get an iteration of an site out as fast as possible. The only factor here is my own time and I&#8217;m in the fortunate position to have some of that available now and again. There&#8217;s a variety of reasons why I might attempt a project, ranging from it may later evolve into something able to draw an income further down the line, that I&#8217;m excited by learning from the tools I choose to use or that I feel moved enough by a problem to do something to try and prompt change. </p>
<p>I had one of these ideas last weekend, whereby I was wondering what the specifics of the fees of kickstarter projects broke down to. The information on what fees are taken is published <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creating%20a%20project#WhatFeesDoesKickChar" title="what fees does kickstarter charge">on their site</a>, so I set about a simple phantomjs script (available <a href="https://github.com/niftydigits/kickstarter.js">on github</a>) that could scrape the information from kickstarter. After doing so, the idea moved on to graphing said information via an app to a simple raphaeljs and again further once I&#8217;d realised some other stats that could be gathered from the info I was grabbing. The end result is <a href="http://starterstats.com">Starter Stats</a> &#8211; which is, (I think) a neat little site for showing stats on any kickstarter project.</p>
<p><a href="http://starterstats.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-03-at-10.16.42-1024x817.png" alt="" title="Starter Stats" width="640" height="510" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-536" /></a></p>
<p>It took a little longer than I&#8217;d hoped, but I&#8217;m really pleased with the final site as it stands. You should also be able to just replace the beginning of any kickstarter project page (<a href="http://kickstarter.com">http://kickstarter.com</a>) with &#8220;<a href="http://starterstats.com&amp;#8221">http://starterstats.com&amp;#8221</a>; and you&#8217;ll be sent to the relevant stats page on the app. Pages are generated on-demand every 15 minutes. Go on, take a look and let me know what you think.</p>
<p>I could have not spent my time on this, instead kicking back and waiting for someone else to build such a tool. But I couldn&#8217;t see that happening. No, better for me to build, learn whilst doing so and move on to my next project. What do you get by not building?</p>
