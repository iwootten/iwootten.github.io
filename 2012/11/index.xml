      <description>When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000&amp;#8242;s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites &amp;#8211; that was it.
As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: &amp;#8220;UX Designers&amp;#8221; were the first to appear on the scene to me, and we&amp;#8217;re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails.</description>

      <description>Given there&amp;#8217;s a bit of lovefilm bashing going on in Wales at the moment, I thought I&amp;#8217;d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm.
Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I&amp;#8217;ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.

I really couldn&amp;#8217;t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema&amp;#8217;s to perform reviews and certainly don&amp;#8217;t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image.</description>
