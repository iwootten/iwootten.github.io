      <description>As a freelancer who has worked with clients using non disclosure agreements in the past, it&amp;rsquo;s often difficult to showcase or build a portfolio of my work. I&amp;rsquo;m not alone on this, I know. Sarah Parmenter for one has posted about this problem as a designer.
As a developer, I sometimes feel it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to easily show a concise representation of my work in a public arena anyway. How can I convey my role in what will usually be a complex process involving many other parties?</description>
