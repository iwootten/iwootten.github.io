There were a number of hurdles I had to overcome in order to get to a state I was happy with, emulating my previous blog structure. This first post details a few of the setup problems and how I&rsquo;ve overcome them.</p><h2 id=using-compass-for-a-jekyll-theme>Using Compass for a Jekyll theme</h2><p>The first problem I hit was my use of compass to create parts of the theme I intended to use for my blog. When attempting to use <a href=https://github.com/mscharley/jekyll-compass>jekyll-compass</a> to enable that, I hit the following error:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>Unable to activate compass-0.12.6, because sass-3.3.7 conflicts with sass <span style=color:#f92672>(</span>~&gt; 3.2.19<span style=color:#f92672>)</span> <span style=color:#f92672>(</span>Gem::LoadError<span style=color:#f92672>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After searching for a bit I came across the <a href=https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2263>following issue</a> which detailed a solution - but unfortunately it didn&rsquo;t work for me. Being somewhat of a newbie to Ruby, I didn&rsquo;t realise that after creating a Gem as instructed in the fix, I actually needed to &ldquo;bundle install&rdquo; it. After a little more digging and tweaking against <a href=http://twitter.com/markturner>Mark Turners</a> advice, I ended up with a Gem file like so:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-ruby data-lang=ruby>source <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;https://rubygems.org&#34;</span>

gem <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;sass&#39;</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;~&gt; 3.2.19&#34;</span>
gem <span style=color:#e6db74>&#39;jekyll-compass&#39;</span>, <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;1.0.6&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Which has finally given me what I wanted.</p><h2 id=using-custom-pygments-themes-for-syntax-highlighting>Using Custom Pygments Themes for Syntax highlighting</h2><p>Jekyll uses pygments for fancy pants syntax highlighting. Although an example syntax.css is linked to in the jekyll documentation, I prefer a darker theme myself. Jekyll doesn&rsquo;t tell you it&rsquo;s possible to generate any one of the numerous pygments styles like this:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>pygmentize -f html -S monokai -a .highlight &gt; monokai.css
</code></pre></div><p>I&rsquo;ve used the monokai theme for my own highlighting. There are demos of each of the themes on the pygments site - <a href=http://pygments.org/demo/357593/>here is an example</a>. You can then use that as the basis for your own custom highlighting. I&rsquo;ve created each one of the 19 possible themes and <a href=https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax>put them up on github</a>.</p><h2 id=moving-to-disqus-commenting>Moving to Disqus Commenting</h2><p>Given I now had a static site, I needed a means of continuing supporting comments. Disqus does just that by embedding comments using javascript into post pages. Adding disqus proved to be the biggest hurdle for me. I had a large number of comments from people on my blog over the years and therefore I didn&rsquo;t want to lose them. After exporting my site as xml and uploading them to disqus, I finally set jekyll loose on my site along with disqus embeds, but I couldn&rsquo;t see them. The problem I found after a frustrating hour or two of uploading new versions of my site over ftp, was jekyll used a trailing slash (as the post is an index within a directory) to denote links to posts. It&rsquo;s possible however to do away with this using .htaccess if you&rsquo;re using Apache.</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-apache data-lang=apache>Options -Multiviews +FollowSymLinks
RewriteEngine <span style=color:#66d9ef>On</span>
RewriteBase /
DirectorySlash <span style=color:#66d9ef>Off</span>

<span style=color:#75715e># remove the trailing slash</span>
RewriteRule ^(.*)\/(\?.*)?$ $1$2 [R=301,L]

<span style=color:#75715e># rewrite /dir/file to /dir/file/index.html</span>
RewriteRule ^([\w\/-]+)(\?.*)?$ $1/index.html$2 [L,T=application/x-httpd-html]
</code></pre></div><p>However, when I began using github pages, this fix didn&rsquo;t work as github only serves static files and doesn&rsquo;t allow use of htaccess. Instead, I had to resign to the fact that I would have to have trailing slashes (apparently they&rsquo;re quicker anyway). This then meant I had to use the Redirect Crawler option of disqus&rsquo;s &ldquo;Migrate Threads&rdquo; wizard (seen below) to crawl my new blog on github and determine where the posts were now located.</p><p></p><p>In my next post I&rsquo;ll go through how I use plugins to support archive, category and tag pages in jekyll.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2014/05/18/bye-bye-wordpress/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
