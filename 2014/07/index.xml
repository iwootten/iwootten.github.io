&amp;mdash; Andy Davies (@AndyDavies) July 23, 2014 I found this pretty interesting, especially given I&amp;rsquo;d used various open source tools for assembling storyboards in the past. I knew it was possible to extract images at desired intervals and left it as that.

Hopefully someone else will find them helpful.
import datetime, calendar # Find the delta between two dates based on a desired number of ranges def datedelta(startdate, enddate, no_of_ranges): start_epoch = calendar.</description></item></channel></rss>
