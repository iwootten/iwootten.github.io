<h1><a href="/2014/03/23/shipping-in-march-weeks-2-3">Shipping in March: Weeks 2 &#038; 3</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">23 Mar 2014</div>
<p>So, anybody paying close attention may have noticed I’ve skipped a week on updating my progress on <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2014/03/03/shipping-in-march">shipping in March</a>. There wasn’t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my <a href="http://niftydigits.com">Nifty Digits</a> site. This hasn’t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month. I spent approximately 3 days on this, 1 on client work and 1 on working on <a href="http://hourglass.io">Hourglass</a>.</p>

<p>This past week however I’ve been working on a revamp for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and breaking out the shopping software I built for it into a new product. The reasoning for this is two-fold – we have stock for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> we want to rave about and sell and I spent a long time building a shopping cart system that’s only ever been used by me! It makes sense (at least to me) that making this byproduct available (as per the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products">37signals mantra</a>). <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> has existed for 7 years now and it’s backend has barely changed in that time and it’s still happily taking orders. This week has been an opportunity to rebuild it in a more robust manner, with more features and without everything that annoys me about current checkout systems.</p>

<p>Granted, it’s currently small and will probably won’t compare in terms of the number of features to cart provider’s that already exist – but what I hope it will provide is a simple, easy to manage way of selling stuff online. I’ve had a huge amount of thoughts on what would be the best way to package it, but have settled on a SaaS based system, rather than self hosted. I’ve been able to use stripe to simplify the way payments are taken and I’m planning on integrating a number of other tools to make life easier for developers.</p>

<p>Again, it’s incomplete and not ready to release – but it is in a place that I’m able to use it as an admin. I’m planning on getting <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">F&#038;B</a> using it and then releasing it on it’s own. If you’d like to see some features then please comment below and let me know. </p>

<p>The one thing I have realised about working on my own projects is the freedom I have to talk about it. No NDAs, no worry of treading on people’s toes, just (hopefully) helpful info. Several blog post ideas have been found over the course of the work I’ve been doing so far this month, one of which has already been published. I’m hoping I’ll finally have something to show you all before the end of this week.</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/10/shipping-in-march-week-1">Shipping in March: Week 1</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">10 Mar 2014</div>
<p>I promised a progress update on how my attempt to get 4 projects shipped this month was going. On my first week, I decided to focus on my time tracking tool, <a href="http://hourglass.io">hourglass</a>. I’ve had this in the works for sometime and unfortunately, it’s fallen by the wayside to client work.</p>

<p>I’ve failed on my first week in getting this released to the world, but I’m far happier with how it’s working now and the value it might give to any potential user than previously. I’d had a working app and a shiny new design for it prior to last week, so first on my agenda was to bring that in and start from there. Beyond that, I bug fixed a number of known issues, followed by building out a number of reporting features which I feel are critical to have before release. It’s also allowed me to better think about the decisions I’ve made regarding implementation and whether or not it makes sense to change them at any stage soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, over this time I hit a major hurdle of my internet connection being killed due to scheduled maintenance. I had been sent a letter on this, but hadn’t clocked the date. I was lucky that in Cardiff we have a number of excellent co-working facilities that allow me to turn up unannounced and fled home for the sanctuary of <a href="http://foundershub.co.uk">Foundershub</a>. In the end I lost probably a couple of hours to this problem and I’m glad I made the decision early on to move before I’d lost the best part of the day.</p>

<p>I’m going to be moving on to my next project this week as planned and move back to hourglass if time allows. I feel that experiencing the variety of these projects will hopefully allow me to continue some kind of momentum. Out of all the ones I have planned, I feel that hourglass is probably one of the larger ones too.</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/07/scaling-a-linear-domain-to-an-ordinal-range-with-d3">Scaling a Linear Domain to an Ordinal Range with d3</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">07 Mar 2014</div>
<p>I’ve had the opportunity of using <a href="http://d3js.org/">d3</a> quite a lot over the past few months for a number of clients. It offers some amazing flexibility for chart generation and much more.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I’d share a quick tip I developed for mapping a linear set of values onto an ordinal scale. For those who’re seasoned pros at d3, this probably seems trivial, but had me stumped for some time today.</p>

<p>I’d picked out a colour palette I wanted to use for a particular graph, as per below:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">colours</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;#B8D0DE&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#9FC2D6&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#86B4CF&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#73A2BD&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;#6792AB&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span></code></pre></div>

<p>The only examples I’ve seen similar to this are where it is assumed you want to vary darkness of colours based on value or <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17321139/mapping-in-d3-ordinal-scales">vary the domain</a> based on the number of colours you want. Not a good fit.</p>

<p>I wanted to pick one of my values based on a linear value from my data set. My first thought was to make use of the ordinal scale function provided by d3. Something like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">colour</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">d3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">scale</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ordinal</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">domain</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">mySortedDataValues</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">colours</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>In doing this, I got something that *looked* a bit like it was working, but not the way I expected. In fact, the way an ordinal scale works is that it provides a 1-to-1 mapping of domain values to the range, rather than any kind of interpolation between them. In this case, it was expecting only 5 distinct data values (to match up against the colours) and for everything over and above that, it wrapped them round to the beginning of the domain again. The solution then is fairly simple once you’ve got your head around that.</p>

<p>What I did next, was to create a scale that gave the index of the colour we were going to be mapping to. This works well, because the indices are linear and d3 has the ability to do the dirty work in that respect.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">colourIndex</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">d3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">scale</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">linear</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">domain</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">d3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)])</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">range</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">colours</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]);</span>

<span class="nx">svg</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">selectAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;circle&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">data</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">enter</span><span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;circle&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">attr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;fill&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">colours</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ceil</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">colourIndex</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">))];</span>
   <span class="p">});</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Here we end up with an index ranging across all the indices of the colour array, and a colour appropriately selected from the palette as expected. You can see the resultant effect in the graph linked to below:</p>

<h1><a href="/2014/03/03/shipping-in-march">Shipping in March</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 Mar 2014</div>
<p>This month, I’ve decided to take some time out to ship projects. </p>

<p>I have a huge list of projects accumulating I’d like to push out of the door, but as a father and freelancer I have lack of a certain commodity in able to achieve them. That would be time.</p>

<p>Currently I don’t have any work booked in for a while, so along with Viv, we’ve decided I should try and get some of these projects released. </p>

<p>That sounds easy, but I’m well aware from past experience it isn’t. I don’t want to work outside of working hours (9-5.30pm) as I know the impact it has on my family. My hope is by setting myself some achievable goals I can at least get some way to ticking off some checkboxes on this growing todo list. </p>

<p>Some of these projects are products I’ve not yet completed, projects I’ve released but need work or ideas that haven’t made it to the build stage yet. As a freelancer, I hope that some of them may even help out other people in a similar situation to me.</p>

<p>Over the coming month, I’m going to attempt to ship at least 4 projects out of the door. 1 a week for 4 weeks. I’ll be blogging about my progress here, and posting summaries of how it went at the end of each week. The end date of the 28th is also my birthday, so it would be great present to myself to have come some way to meeting my goal.</p>
