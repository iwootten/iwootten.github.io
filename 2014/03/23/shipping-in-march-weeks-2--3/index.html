There wasn&#8217;t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my Nifty Digits site. This hasn&#8217;t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month."/>

    <p>So, anybody paying close attention may have noticed I&#8217;ve skipped a week on updating my progress on <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2014/03/03/shipping-in-march">shipping in March</a>. There wasn&#8217;t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my <a href="http://niftydigits.com">Nifty Digits</a> site. This hasn&#8217;t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month. I spent approximately 3 days on this, 1 on client work and 1 on working on <a href="http://hourglass.io">Hourglass</a>.</p>

<p>This past week however I&#8217;ve been working on a revamp for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and breaking out the shopping software I built for it into a new product. The reasoning for this is two-fold &#8211; we have stock for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> we want to rave about and sell and I spent a long time building a shopping cart system that&#8217;s only ever been used by me! It makes sense (at least to me) that making this byproduct available (as per the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products">37signals mantra</a>). <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> has existed for 7 years now and it&#8217;s backend has barely changed in that time and it&#8217;s still happily taking orders. This week has been an opportunity to rebuild it in a more robust manner, with more features and without everything that annoys me about current checkout systems.</p>

<p>Granted, it&#8217;s currently small and will probably won&#8217;t compare in terms of the number of features to cart provider&#8217;s that already exist &#8211; but what I hope it will provide is a simple, easy to manage way of selling stuff online. I&#8217;ve had a huge amount of thoughts on what would be the best way to package it, but have settled on a SaaS based system, rather than self hosted. I&#8217;ve been able to use stripe to simplify the way payments are taken and I&#8217;m planning on integrating a number of other tools to make life easier for developers.</p>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s incomplete and not ready to release &#8211; but it is in a place that I&#8217;m able to use it as an admin. I&#8217;m planning on getting <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">F&#038;B</a> using it and then releasing it on it&#8217;s own. If you&#8217;d like to see some features then please comment below and let me know.</p>

<p>The one thing I have realised about working on my own projects is the freedom I have to talk about it. No NDAs, no worry of treading on people&#8217;s toes, just (hopefully) helpful info. Several blog post ideas have been found over the course of the work I&#8217;ve been doing so far this month, one of which has already been published. I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll finally have something to show you all before the end of this week.</p>
