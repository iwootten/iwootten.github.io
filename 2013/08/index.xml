      <description>10 years ago today, I started this blog. That’s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that’s quite a long time ago.
I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) ditched it in favour of the b2 “weblog tool”, which WordPress was later spawned from.
Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts.</description>
