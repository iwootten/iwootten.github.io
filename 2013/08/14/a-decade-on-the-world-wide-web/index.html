  <div class="post">
    <p>10 years ago today, <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That’s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that’s quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 “weblog tool”</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>
<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed – I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently – which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>
<p>It’s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I’m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>
<p>Given it’s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I’m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it’s the moments I don’t share that are most important to me.</p>
<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>
