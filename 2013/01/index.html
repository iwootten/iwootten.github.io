<h1><a href="/2013/01/22/the-move-towards-static-websites">The Move Towards Static Websites</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">22 Jan 2013</div>
<p>There’s some discussion on new podcast <a href="http://backtofrontshow.com">“The Back to Front Show”</a> on why of late we’re seeing so many static websites cropping up. It seem like now more than ever, we’re seeing both developers and designers jump ship to this way of working, having long been using database backed solutions (such as WordPress/Drupal) to manage their publishing. </p>

<p>When I talk about a static site, I think of it of raw HTML sat on a server and nothing else. However, it seems as if the industry has adopted the term to refer to sites created from tools which are capable of creating/emulating this HTML, whether it be a local, dropbox or a hosted/self-hosted solution. Typically both types of tool are powered through conversion of flat files into the markup which is served publicly. Through using them you can achieve something akin to a typical blog, without the need for a database (or possibly even a server-side language to power it).</p>

<p><strong>Pro’s</strong></p>

<p>Simplicity – Most of the draw toward toward such setups seems to be on the simplicity over flexibility. I can power a site with a minimal setup, but still regularly and simply update and maintain it, using a partial based environment. With a dropbox based solution, I just need to drop my flat files into a folder and everything is updated transparently. Mark Boulton <a href="http://markboulton.co.uk/journal/newblog-newcms">has previously written</a> about his requirements for writing on the web and why he went with <a href="http://statamic.com">Statamic</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I wanted a way of simply publishing words, rather than getting all wrapped up in php, theming files and database problems.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simplicity it seems, rules.</p>

<p>I previously <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2011/09/09/hosting-an-octopress-blog-on-amazon-s3">wrote an article</a> on how you could publish using Octopress and Amazon’s S3 service. For anyone who has a relatively low traffic site, such a setup could also work out cheaper than a monthly hosting package.</p>

<p>Development Time – If you’re one for creating custom themes, a static site is also a much simpler solution than wrestling with styling the innerds of a full fledged cms. Typically posts are stored in markdown and can be styled along with assets using a partial templating system (eg. based on YAML or Liquid). Having recently developed a wordpress theme I can testify to the complexity of having to dig through documentation on function usage and to determine which template file should be modified to achieve what I want within a page.</p>

<p>Source Control – As <a href="http://rickhurst.co.uk">Rick</a> quite rightly points out below in the comments, having all your posts available in flat files makes them perfect for managing/backing up through your revision control tools of choice.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>Customisation – For me, the big loss is the lack of flexibility. I hear everyone cry, “Well, duh – it’s static”. Without a server side language handling requests, I’m unable to schedule posts, handle comments, create forms or trigger email. If I intend on continuing to offer them, I have to find third party services to deal with each of these aspects. I’m well aware there’s services like disqus and wufoo that may solve some of these problems, but it seems like a major hassle to integrate each time something like this is required. It may be that this is just me, you may be perfectly happy using these solutions, or may not require them.</p>

<p>Remote publishing – When using a local based solution (e.g. Jekyll), you don’t have the option of blogging remotely, due to the lack of tools to create and push out your content. Gone are the days of being able to log into a site from your phone and add a small update. For me, this is less of an issue as I can’t recall if I’ve ever written a post in this way and try to be more methodical, less spontaneous about what I’m writing from the comfort of my desktop.</p>

<p><strong>Example Systems</strong></p>

<p>If you’re interested in running a static site, then I’ve listed a few that seem pretty popular at the time of writing, along with a brief list of their features.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> – Locally run, File based, Open source, Powers Github pages.<br />
<a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a> – Locally run, Jekyll/File based, but with preconfigured HTML templates, CSS, Javascript, Open Source<br />
<a href="http://statamic.com">Statamic</a> – Self Hosted, File Based, License Required<br />

<h1><a href="/2013/01/21/new-year-new-theme">New Year, New Theme</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">21 Jan 2013</div>
<p>I’ve long made use of the default theme on WordPress, which I’ve always felt wasn’t entirely “me”. The theme now live is one I’ve been tinkering with for a while now based on the lovely preview design used in the <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a> document editing tool for github. I really like the focus on simplicity and think it suits me well.</p>

<p>I’ve added some different styling for the navigation elements, given they didn’t already exist on <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>. I’ve also added some subtle colour changes when navigating between pages, many of which are based on <a href="http://laurakalbag.com">Laura Kalbag</a>‘s palettes over on <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/LJK">colour lovers</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things I hadn’t counted on was consolidating 10 years worth of blog posts into sensible categories as it was becoming a bit of a mess. When I first started blogging, wordpress didn’t exist, let alone tagging and I think I started out using categories in a manner to replicate them.</p>

<p>There’s still a few things I’m not entirely happy with, such as how navigation is represented for single posts. I intend to tidy the theme up and release it back to the WordPress community, but for now I’m enjoying having finally got it out in the open. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/01/04/why-i-choose-popular-frameworks">Why I Choose Popular Frameworks</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">04 Jan 2013</div>
<p>I feel compelled to write this post so late in the day after clocking <a href="https://gist.github.com/4454814">Tyler Renelle’s rant</a> on github about his problems with the popularity of certain JS frameworks (in the main <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>). After having written apps in a variety of JS frameworks (Backbone, Spine and Meteor), I’ve learned that the feature set of a framework is not the only thing I hold dear when making a choice between them.</p>

<p>Documentation, support, learning curve and most importantly community are what also guide me when building anything. If I need to make an app quickly, I’ll of course develop it in my favourite tool (Backbone), because I’ve been using it for years and therefore doesn’t hold a cost. If I have a problem, I know there’s a ton of hackers who’ve probably already worked on solutions already and mechanisms are in place for them to offer advice. There may be better documented more capable tools, but I can’t foot the expense in the short term that might come with investigating something new and run the risk of hitting problems I can’t solve. In the long term, as a framework grows in popularity and garners these other factors then I may make that jump. </p>

<p>The real reason these frameworks are popular right now is in part because they are already popular.</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/01/02/2012">2012</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">02 Jan 2013</div>
<p>So here we are in a brand new year. 2012 came and went without even the slightest apocalypse. Reflecting on what has been achieved this past year has found favour with others in the web profession so I thought I might try it. More importantly to me, it also seems like a good way to perhaps spur me on to achieve some firm targets this year.</p>

<p>My circumstances have dramatically changed since January last year. I’ve gone from full time employment as a frontend/backend developer for Aardman to being self employed as a frontend developer for the majority of the year. This was (and still is) a scary leap. Finding work, managing finances whilst still trying to be a good father/husband is a sometimes difficult balancing act to perform. So far though (after 9 months and counting), I’m enjoying it.</p>

<h2 id="events">Events</h2>

<p>The amount of conferences/meetups that have been organised this side of the bridge has been fantastic, especially where I’ve not had such a long commute this year. I’ve been able to head along regularly but have had to be fairly choosy about the amount of events I can attend. It’s great to see such a blossoming community round here. I’ve also thought about organising my own event, though I think I have enough on my plate at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p>JS has been my bread and butter this year. I’ve enjoyed digging deeper into various frontend frameworks and learning as much as I can about the language. Where I’ve known relatively little about the ins and outs of other backend languages, I feel like I actually have something to contribute here. I’ve continued tinkering with node.js on the backend and have used it as a build tool for much of the year. I spent some time learning a little Cocoa shortly after leaving Aardman and taking the <a href="https://education.10gen.com/">MongoDB developer training course by 10gen</a>. Whilst I found it difficult fitting the course in around everything, I can highly recommend it. I’ve even developed a couple of things myself, which I hope to tidy up and release over the coming year. I’ve not been able to write a great deal about what I’m learning, but hope that will soon change. Some of my most popular posts here relate to use of CouchDB and node.js from many moons ago.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>I already had a number of side projects running before the start of last year but I’ve had a number of ideas for tools and a fairly major service I’d like to work on across 2012. I plan on releasing more details soon, but would love to have a recurring revenue stream from one of these coming in at some point this year. I find I can easily stray from this path and get distracted by other less fruitful ideas I have. I’m going to make it a resolution that I remain committed to one thing at a time, whilst putting to bed ideas that haven’t worked out.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>As much as I feel like I have adequate design chops, I’ve not had the opportunity to demonstrate them publicly. I’d love to redesign <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk">several</a> <a href="http://niftydigits.com">of my</a> <a href="http://fairandbare.com">sites</a> to a standard that I feel reflect my skills as a web craftsman. I’m currently working on developing a wordpress theme which I hope to contribute back to the community once I’m done.</p>

<p>So in all, it’s been a good, 2012. I’ve not fitted everything I might like in, but much of the content of my projects and work I had no idea about back at the start of last year. That also means you have something to look forward to from me in 2013. </p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone.</p>
