    <p>I suffer from idea overload. It seems that every day I have an idea for something. As a developer, I&#8217;m lucky in that to be able to take an idea to inception very quickly. Best of all, I can show it at inception stage to a huge audience (if I had one), garner feedback and quickly iterate on that idea. To date, I&#8217;ve mainly created these by myself &#8211; a casualty of doing paid work in the main like this too.</p>

<p>Most of these ideas in the have been simple hacks &#8211; <a href="http://loveletterd.com">solutions to things that bug me</a>. <a href="http://fairandbare.com">One of them has been a proper business too</a>. I&#8217;m able to do something and make it happen, to potentially tap a huge audience. Get them to that first step. The problem I have is, not a single one of these so much as turns a profit, though they serve as wonderful educational devices for me. I would hazard a guess that some of them have indirectly got me work.</p>

<p>Some of my ideas never get past the domain registration phase before being knocked on the head. A friend many years ago gave me the great quote that &#8216;My domains are my todo list&#8217;. This totally hits the nail on the head for me &#8211; if I&#8217;ve felt like an idea was good enough to make it to the registration phase, there&#8217;s something there worth pursuing. Unfortunately, I have quite a long list to work through.</p>

<p>I heard it said that &#8220;The Developer Dream&#8221; is that we (developers) &#8220;build a product/service which we&#8217;re able to earn a living from&#8221;. But the majority of developers I know, don&#8217;t even begin to pursue the ideas they have. This surprises me.</p>

<p>There seems to be such an abundance of opportunities that I can&#8217;t imagine not building my own ideas, however bad they might seem to others.</p>

<p>Why hold back? Time? Yes, we have other commitments &#8211; family, work and maybe even a hobby or two. I&#8217;m not suggesting we make drastic sacrifices or sell our kids in order to create stuff. I&#8217;d would however, like to think that the payoff for building our ideas might make our initial holdups seem insignificant longer term. <a href="https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/05/03/if-you-build-it">I&#8217;ve said it before</a> and I can&#8217;t speak from as the voice of successful experience, but what do I get out of never trying?</p>
