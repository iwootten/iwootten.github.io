          <h1><a href="/2013/03/28/so-you-want-to-run-a-fairtrade-business">So You Want to Run a Fairtrade Business?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">28 Mar 2013</div>

          <p>This is a brief retrospective of what I&#8217;ve learned in the 6 years I&#8217;ve been running <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com" title="Fair &#038; Bare">Fair &#038; Bare</a>, a Fairtrade t-shirt company along with my wife. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a new follower of mine, you heard right &#8211; <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">I run a Fairtrade t-shirt company</a>. I&#8217;ve not actively been marketing it more recently for a number of reasons, but I still have a strong belief in our original vision. That vision was that Fairtrade shirts at the time weren&#8217;t being well received by the world, despite being available. We believed they could be, if we were only to find some that had good designs (and were possibly less &#8216;preachy&#8217;).</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what we set out to do. From 2007-2011 we were running as an online design competition, inspired mainly by Threadless and Emptees, and helped via a great community of designers through a site I built entirely myself (whilst doing a PhD, getting married and buying a house). I&#8217;ve since learned that I don&#8217;t believe the competition sourced design is the best fit for what we are trying to do, but it constantly excited me that we *could* do it. I still hope some day to be proved wrong though.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The Ethical market pales in comparison to the cheaper alternatives. That probably won&#8217;t come as news to you. Most people &#8211; like it or not, will buy cheap over quality if they&#8217;re perceived to be comparable. This has certainly been my experience so far, having touted our wares at student markets, Fairtrade stalls and online. Be prepared to experience it first hand, and to repeatedly go over your story to get people to part with their cash. That is, after all, your unique selling point.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re at it, if you&#8217;re selling online, be prepared to experience the same. When so much hard work has gone into creating your goods, you&#8217;ll find it heartbreaking to have a couple of people take up an offer from a newsletter of thousands. My advice would be not to get your hopes upâ€¦.</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t entirely despair. When you make those few sales you&#8217;ll feel such a strong connection with your customer, even though you may never meet them. Repeat customers will give you a warm glow inside and smile all day long.</p>
<p>The Fairtrade supply chain is slow(er) and (more) fallible. We constantly had trouble with every supplier we used for our shirts over how quickly we could obtain stock and sometimes with the stock itself. Obviously, once our community had selected a design, we wanted it printed and available for sale. We knew we would have to wait for designs to be printed, but what we hadn&#8217;t counted on was how long it could take to get hold of shirts we&#8217;d ordered. Other businesses might be able to cope better with such delays. 2 months to go from selected to online is not ideal for our business model that relies on constant momentum, especially when we were dealing with a a single product at a time. </p>
<p>Depending on your supplier, you may also experience variations in sizes and colour. Be wary, you&#8217;re going to have to deal with all the resulting issues that arise from these problems with your customers or be lumbered with stock you&#8217;re unable to shift.</p>
<p>Times are hard for everyone. Since having started, 2 of the 3 suppliers we used have shut up shop and the third has changed it&#8217;s supplier. This has drastically reduced the options for us to the point of being unviable, which is one of the reasons we haven&#8217;t put out a new design since 2011. (If anyone is able to point me in the direction of other wholesale ethical brands, I&#8217;d be keen to hear about them).</p>
<p>Fairtrade cotton, Fairtrade or fair trade? Organic? Soil association certified? You need to be aware of the differences, because competitors will use similar terms. Even though they mean different things to you, most customers don&#8217;t know the difference and lump them all in the same good for the producer pot.</p>
<p>First impressions count. Originally, we used to send out our t-shirts in recycled packaging we sourced from envelopes we had kicking around our house. I have to cringe at this now &#8211; the idea that old crumply packets were being received with sticky-taped-on labels. That was our first physical impression on our customer. *Sigh*. Our heart was in the right place though, we didn&#8217;t (and still don&#8217;t) want to be creating more waste. We&#8217;ve since moved on to shipping goods out in recycled packets.</p>
<p>Marketing is key. When you&#8217;re not marketing your goods, you&#8217;re not seen to be active. Just by talking about your business, you&#8217;ll get interest in your product and make sales. Our buzz came from regular competitions and launches of new shirts. With every new shirt we&#8217;d let our mailing list, community and followers know of its arrival.</p>
<p>Finally, a word on branding. I constantly wrestle with wether we would have been better off branding ourselves first and foremost a t-shirt design company, rather than a Fairtrade one. I think the answer is yes. Our whole ethos was originally based around the lack of well designed Fairtrade shirts. Ultimately, if a design looks good, a customer is going to be happy paying a little more if it&#8217;s what they want. The ethical aspect of the cotton is, in their mind, a bonus. But if they&#8217;re not even visiting your site or stall because they see you first and foremost as an ethical brand, and that doesn&#8217;t entirely float their boat, then you&#8217;ve lost a sale.</p>
<p>The whole experience of running <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> has been a bit of a roller coaster of highs and lows. I&#8217;ve learned so much from running it and hope to continue to do so.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be right of me to post about <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> here without letting my readers in on a special offer. For this Easter weekend, when you buy two shirts, you&#8217;ll get the third free on using the code &#8220;EASTEREGG&#8221; when checking out.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/03/01/breaking-up-relationships-with-couchdb">Breaking up Relationships with CouchDB</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">01 Mar 2013</div>

          <p><em>[NB: This is an unpublished post I wrote in 2010 on getting started with CouchDB. Therefore, despite all the code and examples being relevant, it may be considered somewhat &#39;belated&#39;]</em></p>
<p>Beware &#8211; there&#8217;s a bunch of home wreckers out there intent on removing the love of your life and replacing it with a wicked mistress.</p>
<p>For me, my first experiments working with databases were performed with Oracle, the staple of our computer science course at the time. We were taught how to identify common structures in what we wanted to store (or had already been stored) and how to represent the relationships which existed between them. There was an entire series of lectures dedicated to this fine art, much of which I now can&#8217;t remember.</p>
<p>There has been an uptake in the number of developers working with NoSQL, or document oriented databases. These alternatives do not require decisions on subdividing documents into multiple record structures to be made at all, instead allowing the entire document to be recorded as a series of simple variable types. The contents of each document can vary from one document to the next. For the majority of developers who work with relational databases, this might come as a bit of a shock.</p>
<p>There are a number of varieties of NoSQL flavours currently available: CouchDB, Cassandra and MongoDB are a few of the hot ones right now. I&#8217;m not going to discuss the pros and cons of each right here (for that I&#8217;d refer you to The Changelog&#8217;s NoSQL smackdown podcasts), but rather give you a whistle stop tour of CouchDB, which I&#8217;ve been working with for a few years now.</p>
<p>If you want to follow along, you&#8217;ll need to head to the CouchDB site and read up on <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Installation">installation</a> for your platform. I&#8217;m using the <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB server app</a>, which is nice and self contained.</p>
<p>Document oriented storage gives me the ability not to have to worry about the structure of my documents prior to storage. From my own point of view this is a huge timesaver as my apps often tend to focus on a single type of document. Think of a blog post stored in a mysql database, we have a table for the post along with all its metadata, a table for the comments and maybe another for recording pingbacks. The same blog post in couch could be represented like so:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='json'>{
   "<span class="hljs-attribute">_id</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"83ab09b88836ab714f592293d4e02845"</span></span>,
   "<span class="hljs-attribute">title</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"My Blog Post"</span></span>,
   "<span class="hljs-attribute">content</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"</span></span>,
   "<span class="hljs-attribute">comments</span>": <span class="hljs-value">[{"<span class="hljs-attribute">ian</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"You're a wally"</span></span>},{"<span class="hljs-attribute">Some user</span>": <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"This post sucks"</span></span>}]
</span>}</code></pre></div><p>A document based db may well not be suitable for the nature of your application. However, I&#8217;ve found in lots of cases, it is.</p>
<h2 id="rest-style-interface">Rest Style Interface</h2>
<p>CouchDB works across a REST style interface. To write documents back to couch, you call a HTTP PUT or POST with your JSON structure. To read documents, you call a GET and to delete them you call DELETE. For example, to add a document with &#8220;_id=someid&#8221; to the database &#8220;blog&#8221;, you would call the following:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>curl http://<span class="hljs-number">127.0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">0.1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">5984</span>/blog/someid -X PUT <span class="hljs-operator">-d</span> <span class="hljs-string">'{"Title":"Another Blog Post", "Content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit"}'</span></code></pre></div><p>Similarly you can HTTP GET this uri to return the document just added. Saving the document to a couch store will add another field, &#8220;_rev&#8221; which represents the particular revision of the document you&#8217;re storing. Every time you update this document, it will be stored as a new document, along with a new revision number. You have access to all these revisions within couch, or you can choose to cleanup the database by compacting and removing all but the most recent revision of documents. Another blog entry document without any comments would be perfectly valid stored in the same database, as well as a document featuring just an array of pingback items.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that the structures are JSON objects. This is how all objects are exchanged between couch and other languages and over couch&#8217;s REST interface. Heading to where we stored the above blog document &#8220;<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5984/blog&amp;#8221">http://127.0.0.1:5984/blog&amp;#8221</a>; in your browser yields a collection of metadata expressed in a JSON structure about that particular database. Appending &#8220;/83ab09b88836ab714f592293d4e02845&#8243; (the id of the document) gives us the original blog document.</p>
<p>This, in turn works wonderfully well with certain frontend frameworks &#8211; such as <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone</a>. If you configure your backbone models to construct URLs the way CouchDB expects them, you can effectively have a frontend app driven by just a CouchDB store. As CouchDB returns JSON objects, it&#8217;s able to correctly parse and load them into your backbone app.</p>
<h2 id="map-reduce">Map/Reduce</h2>
<p>To support the extraction of substructures and sorting within these documents, couch has the concept of map/reduce built straight into its core. Futon, couch&#8217;s built in administration application, makes creation of these a very simple process. Maps and Reductions are described in Javascript, which is great given most of us are making more and more use of it these days. Head over to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils">http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils</a> and you&#8217;ll see your collection of databases right away. Navigate to the blog database and under the view dropdown, select temporary view. Couch automatically populates this with a default temporary view:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">doc</span>) </span>{
  emit(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>, doc);
}</code></pre></div><p>This basically reads as: for each document emit an object with a null key and the document as the value which is what you&#8217;ll see if you go ahead and run it. Not particularly exciting really, but by changing the null key to doc.title, we can emit all those blog posts sorted by title. To do something a little more complicated, such as determining the number of comments for each blog post we can make use of the reduce function too.</p>
<p>Map:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span>(<span class="hljs-params">doc</span>) </span>{
  <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> i=<span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &amp;lt; doc.comments.length; i++){
   emit(doc.title, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>);
  }
}</code></pre></div><p>Reduce:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params">keys, values</span>)</span>{
   <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> sum(values);
}</code></pre></div><p>Here, we cycle each of the comments for every blog post and emit a single value 1 for every comment. Our reduce function takes both the entire key and value set which are emitted from the map function for each document and calculates the sum of values sent to it. With these two very basic functions we can support all the queries we might want to make of the database. You can permanently store this entire map/reduce query as a view within couch to be called later. When a document is inserted which effects the result of the query, the map/reduce will be re-evaluated on the next call. It turns out that storing and querying documents in this way can be extremely performant.</p>
<p>I very much enjoy having the ability to write my queries in a language I&#8217;m familiar with to retrieve results, rather than having to dip into MySQL voodoo.</p>
<p><em>So, there you have it, CouchDB &#8211; I may well follow this up at a later date with a comparison with Mongo, given I&#8217;m now a certified developer.</em></p>
