      <description>This is a brief retrospective of what I&amp;#8217;ve learned in the 6 years I&amp;#8217;ve been running Fair &amp;#038; Bare, a Fairtrade t-shirt company along with my wife.
If you&amp;#8217;re a new follower of mine, you heard right &amp;#8211; I run a Fairtrade t-shirt company. I&amp;#8217;ve not actively been marketing it more recently for a number of reasons, but I still have a strong belief in our original vision. That vision was that Fairtrade shirts at the time weren&amp;#8217;t being well received by the world, despite being available.</description>

      <description>[NB: This is an unpublished post I wrote in 2010 on getting started with CouchDB. Therefore, despite all the code and examples being relevant, it may be considered somewhat &amp;lsquo;belated&amp;rsquo;]
Beware &amp;#8211; there&amp;#8217;s a bunch of home wreckers out there intent on removing the love of your life and replacing it with a wicked mistress.
For me, my first experiments working with databases were performed with Oracle, the staple of our computer science course at the time.</description>
