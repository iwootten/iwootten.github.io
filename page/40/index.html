          <p>I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don&#8217;t think is interesting at all, but I&#8217;ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others. This perhaps gives a few insights as to why my blogging doesn&#8217;t occur as often as those who feel it neccessary to pour out their innermost thoughts every day, or maybe I don&#8217;t have enough of them to warrant talking about&#8230;</p>

          <p>That last post aside heres a mildly amusing anecdote that happened to me whilst in B&#038;Q a couple of weeks ago featuring a sweet old welsh lady.</p>
<p>Old Lady (Looking at lampshades): &#8220;Is that the ACTUAL price of these!?&#8221;<br>Me (Bewildered, wondering past end of aisle): &#8220;Well, yeah, it says so on the label&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;&pound;11.99! I saw &#8216;em for &pound;1 on Newport Road!&#8221;<br>Me (Still bewildered, now in aisle): &#8220;Oh. Right. Ok&#8230;&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna have to go all the way back down there now..&#8221;<br>Me: &#8220;Hmmm&#8230;&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;Are you sure these are the only ones you&#8217;ve got?!&#8221;<br>Me (Clued in now): &#8220;Er, yeah, I don&#8217;t actually work here.&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m sorry love (now embarrased to look me in the eye, me backing away), its because you&#8217;ve got a black shirt on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, wearing &#8220;a black shirt&#8221; is certainly the least amount of requirements I&#8217;ve had for any job. It might have been hilarious to just continue the appalling customer service and hand in one of (my co-)workers names as my own when she asked for it&#8230;</p>

          <p>Some of you may have noticed that I&#8217;ve moved. Whats that? You didn&#8217;t? Oh well, cheers then, how much of a friend are you? I never read your blog either.

<p>This week I have been mostly stressing about work, sitting at home alone, watching repeats, finding interesting links through the wonder of <a href="http://del.icio.us" title="Social Bookmarks">del.icio.us</a> and making my mark on other peoples property (an all too common occurence, apologies 48 Mackie Pl).</p>

          <p>So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">ROKR E1</a> &#8211; a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> &#8211; a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod &#8211; how many have there been now? There&#8217;s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3&#8242;s just yet &#8211; except my portable fat hard drive. We&#8217;ll have to wait until that Toshiba 80Gb model see&#8217;s the light of day, but then that&#8217;d still be cutting it rather close. Anyway, thats not what the nano&#8217;s about&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the most avid enthusiast when it come to apple products, but this thing features a sporty colour screen supposedly for photo display and is tiny!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj&#8217;ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe&#8217;s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I&#8217;m a bit out of practice. </p>
<p>Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band <a href="http://www.walkingwounded.co.uk">&#8220;Walking Wounded&#8221;</a> all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support). One of the conversations I had while I was there was with the infamous Carl (who was playing some crazy dub and reggae), revealing the sad news that Fridays <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com">&#8220;off the shelf&#8221;</a> at BSB is to come to an end. Its a bit of a shame, the guys had a great set-up there, gave me the odd gig offer now and then and I&#8217;ve met a fair few randoms through events they&#8217;ve put on, always enjoying it due to all the guys having a sound appreciation of good music. So long&#8230;</p>
<p>An afterparty from Zoe&#8217;s meant a bit of a late one on Friday, although a night absolutely chocka of funky soul, breaks and beats from full-fat at Moloko&#8217;s. It was a great night, great music and a great change to be making such a trip with a posse rather than being a loner. The same can be said of last night, due to the trip over to Bristol for Jurassic 5&#8242;s performance. Although <a href="http://www.cutchemist.com">Cut Chemist</a> wasn&#8217;t there, Numark absolutely rocked the place with the solo&#8217;s he&#8217;d put together, with one crazy &#8220;do-wop&#8221; solo. It was fab to finally see him in action, after all the vids I&#8217;ve watched of him with Chemist and DJ Shadow. I stunk so much of weed when I returned it was disgusting.</p>
<p>Anyway, seems I&#8217;ve been inspired to check out a few random artists on Warp, namely Brothemstates (did the music for the Sprite ad) and the Rip Off Artist from Kid 606&#8242;s Tigerbeat Label. I also ordered the KEEPINTIME dvd off ninjatune by, er, pretty much everyone :). <a href="http://www.warprecords.com">Warp</a> and <a href="http://www.ninjatune.net">Ninjatune</a> are both having sales of sorts at the moment if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
