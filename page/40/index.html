      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;m feeling rather fragile at the moment, which is really annoying because the majority of the time I&#8217;m the picture of health. It started yesterday, but I thought I&#8217;d got over it only for headaches and tummy aches to return by the evening. Unfortunately, it meant I wasn&#8217;t best of hosts to Hannah who stayed over on Sunday because of a stereophonics gig she was going to. I had to fix her up with Jon to go with as her mate decided to back out on her pretty late. Hannah got a few odd looks at the prospect of her taking her inflatable guitar though.. </p>
<p>Todays been enrolment, which is just a pain as well due to central being at talybont and departmental being down in Queens. I think I must have been quite out of it as I just randomly decided to queue with people in trevithick, until realising that actually my enrolment was in a completely different building and had been every year I&#8217;d been there.</p>
<p>Theres noticeably more students around here and less parking spaces. So much so as some old welsh coot decided to give me verbal for no apparent reason outside my house. I won&#8217;t describe in detail what happened but suffice to say he was obviously mad. Anyways, I guess there&#8217;ll be more of that in the pipeline over the coming year&#8230;</p>

          <p>I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don&#8217;t think is interesting at all, but I&#8217;ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others. This perhaps gives a few insights as to why my blogging doesn&#8217;t occur as often as those who feel it neccessary to pour out their innermost thoughts every day, or maybe I don&#8217;t have enough of them to warrant talking about&#8230;</p>

          <p>That last post aside heres a mildly amusing anecdote that happened to me whilst in B&#038;Q a couple of weeks ago featuring a sweet old welsh lady.</p>
<p>Old Lady (Looking at lampshades): &#8220;Is that the ACTUAL price of these!?&#8221;<br>Me (Bewildered, wondering past end of aisle): &#8220;Well, yeah, it says so on the label&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;&pound;11.99! I saw &#8216;em for &pound;1 on Newport Road!&#8221;<br>Me (Still bewildered, now in aisle): &#8220;Oh. Right. Ok&#8230;&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna have to go all the way back down there now..&#8221;<br>Me: &#8220;Hmmm&#8230;&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;Are you sure these are the only ones you&#8217;ve got?!&#8221;<br>Me (Clued in now): &#8220;Er, yeah, I don&#8217;t actually work here.&#8221;<br>Old Lady: &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m sorry love (now embarrased to look me in the eye, me backing away), its because you&#8217;ve got a black shirt on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, wearing &#8220;a black shirt&#8221; is certainly the least amount of requirements I&#8217;ve had for any job. It might have been hilarious to just continue the appalling customer service and hand in one of (my co-)workers names as my own when she asked for it&#8230;</p>

          <p>Some of you may have noticed that I&#8217;ve moved. Whats that? You didn&#8217;t? Oh well, cheers then, how much of a friend are you? I never read your blog either. For those who didn&#8217;t &#8211; take a look in the address bar, I&#8217;m now at <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk" title="This page">www.ianwootten.co.uk</a> (Highly original I know!).</p>
<p>This week I have been mostly stressing about work, sitting at home alone, watching repeats, finding interesting links through the wonder of <a href="http://del.icio.us" title="Social Bookmarks">del.icio.us</a> and making my mark on other peoples property (an all too common occurence, apologies 48 Mackie Pl).</p>

          <p>So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/overview/">iTunes</a>, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">ROKR E1</a> &#8211; a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod nano</a> &#8211; a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod &#8211; how many have there been now? There&#8217;s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3&#8242;s just yet &#8211; except my portable fat hard drive. We&#8217;ll have to wait until that Toshiba 80Gb model see&#8217;s the light of day, but then that&#8217;d still be cutting it rather close. Anyway, thats not what the nano&#8217;s about&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not the most avid enthusiast when it come to apple products, but this thing features a sporty colour screen supposedly for photo display and is tiny!</p>
