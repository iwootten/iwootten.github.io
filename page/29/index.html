      <div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I spent a large amount of time last week, after realising that I could very easy install compiz and XGL on my machine at uni, trying to install it upon my home machine. As its 64 bit, and owing to previous problems I&#8217;d experienced installing 64 bit applications (like linux for instance), I spent the best part of 2 days attempting to install both, before caving and completely giving up.I got to the stage where XGL is installed properly and seems to work ok, but the compiz gnome window manager isn&#8217;t working properly, meaning I have no borders to any panes I create.It&#8217;s not like I need a whizzy 4 sided cube spinning around, but I thought it might be fun&#8230;</p>

          <p>Hi there, we&#8217;ve not spoken in a while. How&#8217;s you?It seems I&#8217;ve been succumbing to a lifestyle of late that I wish I would never end up at &#8211; that of working within a &#8220;routine&#8221;. I must be getting old. The whole of last week seemed a little bit of a drain, working my ass off trying to get tiny parts of code to work properly in the day and the rest of the time being tired that I was staying up late to give myself alone time in the evenings. The day and evening seem to blur to become a big mess when I&#8217;m working hard, I lose all concept of what should really be important to me and where my efforts should really be put.Anyway, I&#8217;ve been up to lots other than working, went off to greenbelt last week, which was unexpectedly cool (especially the Ukelele Orchestra!) and spent this weekend with very little time spare once it had all been used up with meeting people, socialising and whatnot. Oh deary me, whats going on? Do I finally have a life?</p>

      <div class="author_meta">23 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">code igniter</a> tonight, a php mvc framework. I discovered it yesterday, not realising that such things were available for php. As its extremely lightweight and seems to speeding up things no-end already, I reckon I&#8217;ll probably be using it on some of my new <a href="http://www.slimshot.org">slimshot</a> projects I&#8217;m planning on working on soon. I just need to get another life somewhere so I can actually go about implementing all this stuff.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to create a site which attracts lot of attention for ages. Not to create some profit-making venture, just to know that my voice was being listened too elsewhere and hopefully appreciated. I suppose that goes for my PhD too. It&#8217;s kind of depressing however that almost everything ever has been done, and every avenue seems blocked in both respects. How do you contribute to a world that is uninsterested in what you have to say? Being a man of high moral standards (!) I don&#8217;t ditch them and say what I think people want to hear, I suffer at their hands silently instead.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">13 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>A couple of weeks back I discovered a slug in cash converters. Well, a usb2 external disk to nas drive converter affectionately known as the slug. Seeing as how I&#8217;ve been considering purchasing one, I figured shelling out the £25 was worth it for an experiment with <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org">installing linux</a> on it for a bit. The D-Link nslu2 features two usb2 connection points for hooking up usb2 drives, but I didn&#8217;t really feel like sacrificing my university external box as this usually comes in quite useful.Enter an icy box, one of the new sata ones, to encompass a normal hard drive &#8211; which fitted in quite well with the sata drive I purchased for my machine at uni, but never actually ended up using. In total i spent about £90 on the lot I think.I decided to get on with moving everything onto it yesterday, and first off was the 75Gb mp3 collection &#8211; taking a total of about 4 hours&#8230;. Next&#8217;ll be the 10Gb downloads directory (which I could probably do with emptying really).If I ever get round to installing linux (as it sounds a little bit of an arse) upon the slug, it could be quite sweet to set it up with <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_features.html">slim server</a> to finally have a completely silent mp3 stream in my house&#8230;..of course, this also would require investing in a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_overview.html">squeezebox</a>, or something similar.</p>
