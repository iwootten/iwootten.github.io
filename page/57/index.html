          <p>As my last post indicated, I recently made the decision to leave wordpress for jekyll for my blogging software of choice. There were a number of hurdles I had to overcome in order to get to a state I was happy with, emulating my previous blog structure. This first post details a few of the setup problems and how I&#39;ve overcome them.</p>
<h2 id="using-compass-for-a-jekyll-theme">Using Compass for a Jekyll theme</h2>
<p>The first problem I hit was my use of compass to create parts of the theme I intended to use for my blog. When attempting to use <a href="https://github.com/mscharley/jekyll-compass">jekyll-compass</a> to enable that, I hit the following error:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>Unable to activate compass-0.12.6, because sass-3.3.7 conflicts with sass (~&gt; 3.2.19) (Gem::LoadError)</code></pre></div><p>After searching for a bit I came across the <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/2263">following issue</a> which detailed a solution - but unfortunately it didn&#39;t work for me. Being somewhat of a newbie to Ruby, I didn&#39;t realise that after creating a Gem as instructed in the fix, I actually needed to &quot;bundle install&quot; it. After a little more digging and tweaking against <a href="http://twitter.com/markturner">Mark Turners</a> advice, I ended up with a Gem file like so:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='ruby'>source <span class="hljs-string">"https://rubygems.org"</span>

gem <span class="hljs-string">'sass'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"~&gt; 3.2.19"</span>
gem <span class="hljs-string">'jekyll-compass'</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"1.0.6"</span></code></pre></div><p>Which has finally given me what I wanted.</p>
<h2 id="using-custom-pygments-themes-for-syntax-highlighting">Using Custom Pygments Themes for Syntax highlighting</h2>
<p>Jekyll uses pygments for fancy pants syntax highlighting. Although an example syntax.css is linked to in the jekyll documentation, I prefer a darker theme myself. Jekyll doesn&#39;t tell you it&#39;s possible to generate any one of the numerous pygments styles like this:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>pygmentize <span class="hljs-operator">-f</span> html -S monokai <span class="hljs-operator">-a</span> .highlight &gt; monokai.css</code></pre></div><p>I&#39;ve used the monokai theme for my own highlighting. There are demos of each of the themes on the pygments site - <a href="http://pygments.org/demo/357593/">here is an example</a>. You can then use that as the basis for your own custom highlighting. I&#39;ve created each one of the 19 possible themes and <a href="https://github.com/iwootten/jekyll-syntax">put them up on github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="moving-to-disqus-commenting">Moving to Disqus Commenting</h2>
<p>Given I now had a static site, I needed a means of continuing supporting comments. Disqus does just that by embedding comments using javascript into post pages. Adding disqus  proved to be the biggest hurdle for me. I had a large number of comments from people on my blog over the years and therefore I didn&#39;t want to lose them. After exporting my site as xml and uploading them to disqus, I finally set jekyll loose on my site along with disqus embeds, but I couldn&#39;t see them. The problem I found after a frustrating hour or two of uploading new versions of my site over ftp, was jekyll used a trailing slash (as the post is an index within a directory) to denote links to posts. It&#39;s possible however to do away with this using .htaccess if you&#39;re using Apache.</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='apache'><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-common">Options</span></span> -Multiviews +FollowSymLinks
<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-common">RewriteEngine</span></span> <span class="hljs-literal">On</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">RewriteBase</span> /
<span class="hljs-keyword">DirectorySlash</span> <span class="hljs-literal">Off</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># remove the trailing slash</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-common">RewriteRule</span></span> ^(.*)\/(\?.*)?$ <span class="hljs-number">$1</span><span class="hljs-number">$2</span><span class="hljs-sqbracket"> [R=301,L]</span>

<span class="hljs-comment"># rewrite /dir/file to /dir/file/index.html</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-common">RewriteRule</span></span> ^([\w\/-]+)(\?.*)?$ <span class="hljs-number">$1</span>/index.html<span class="hljs-number">$2</span><span class="hljs-sqbracket"> [L,T=application/x-httpd-html]</span></code></pre></div><p>However, when I began using github pages, this fix didn&#39;t work as github only serves static files and doesn&#39;t allow use of htaccess. Instead, I had to resign to the fact that I would have to have trailing slashes (apparently they&#39;re quicker anyway). This then meant I had to use the Redirect Crawler option of disqus&#39;s &quot;Migrate Threads&quot; wizard (seen below) to crawl my new blog on github and determine where the posts were now located.</p>
<p><img src="http://ianwootten.co.uk/images/screen-2014-05-20.png" title="Disqus Migrate Threads Wizard" /></p>
<p>In my next post I&#39;ll go through how I use plugins to support archive, category and tag pages in jekyll.</p>

          <p>So, anybody paying close attention may have noticed I&#8217;ve skipped a week on updating my progress on <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2014/03/03/shipping-in-march">shipping in March</a>. There wasn&#8217;t much to report in week 2 aside from I was busily updating my <a href="http://niftydigits.com">Nifty Digits</a> site. This hasn&#8217;t yet gone live, mainly due to some restrictions on current client projects and publishing about my previous work. I hope to be able to publish it before the end of the month. I spent approximately 3 days on this, 1 on client work and 1 on working on <a href="http://hourglass.io">Hourglass</a>.</p>
<p>This past week however I&#8217;ve been working on a revamp for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and breaking out the shopping software I built for it into a new product. The reasoning for this is two-fold &#8211; we have stock for <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> we want to rave about and sell and I spent a long time building a shopping cart system that&#8217;s only ever been used by me! It makes sense (at least to me) that making this byproduct available (as per the <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1620-sell-your-by-products">37signals mantra</a>). <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> has existed for 7 years now and it&#8217;s backend has barely changed in that time and it&#8217;s still happily taking orders. This week has been an opportunity to rebuild it in a more robust manner, with more features and without everything that annoys me about current checkout systems.</p>
<p>Granted, it&#8217;s currently small and will probably won&#8217;t compare in terms of the number of features to cart provider&#8217;s that already exist &#8211; but what I hope it will provide is a simple, easy to manage way of selling stuff online. I&#8217;ve had a huge amount of thoughts on what would be the best way to package it, but have settled on a SaaS based system, rather than self hosted. I&#8217;ve been able to use stripe to simplify the way payments are taken and I&#8217;m planning on integrating a number of other tools to make life easier for developers.</p>
<p>Again, it&#8217;s incomplete and not ready to release &#8211; but it is in a place that I&#8217;m able to use it as an admin. I&#8217;m planning on getting <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">F&#038;B</a> using it and then releasing it on it&#8217;s own. If you&#8217;d like to see some features then please comment below and let me know.</p>
<p>The one thing I have realised about working on my own projects is the freedom I have to talk about it. No NDAs, no worry of treading on people&#8217;s toes, just (hopefully) helpful info. Several blog post ideas have been found over the course of the work I&#8217;ve been doing so far this month, one of which has already been published. I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll finally have something to show you all before the end of this week.</p>

          <p>I promised a progress update on how my attempt to get 4 projects shipped this month was going. On my first week, I decided to focus on my time tracking tool, <a href="http://hourglass.io">hourglass</a>. I&#8217;ve had this in the works for sometime and unfortunately, it&#8217;s fallen by the wayside to client work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve failed on my first week in getting this released to the world, but I&#8217;m far happier with how it&#8217;s working now and the value it might give to any potential user than previously. I&#8217;d had a working app and a shiny new design for it prior to last week, so first on my agenda was to bring that in and start from there. Beyond that, I bug fixed a number of known issues, followed by building out a number of reporting features which I feel are critical to have before release. It&#8217;s also allowed me to better think about the decisions I&#8217;ve made regarding implementation and whether or not it makes sense to change them at any stage soon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over this time I hit a major hurdle of my internet connection being killed due to scheduled maintenance. I had been sent a letter on this, but hadn&#8217;t clocked the date. I was lucky that in Cardiff we have a number of excellent co-working facilities that allow me to turn up unannounced and fled home for the sanctuary of <a href="http://foundershub.co.uk">Foundershub</a>. In the end I lost probably a couple of hours to this problem and I&#8217;m glad I made the decision early on to move before I&#8217;d lost the best part of the day.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to be moving on to my next project this week as planned and move back to hourglass if time allows. I feel that experiencing the variety of these projects will hopefully allow me to continue some kind of momentum. Out of all the ones I have planned, I feel that hourglass is probably one of the larger ones too.</p>

          <p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000VUVG3E/1847192505/staplediet-21"><img src="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/1847192505.02.TZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Learning jQuery" /></a>Learning jQuery takes a look at the JavaScript library jQuery by Jonathan Chaffer and Karl Swedberg, whom run <a href="http://learningjquery.com">learningjquery.com</a>, a popular resource to jQuery developers. Jonathan and Karl work through a example based approach of common problems in web application development to demonstrate how jQuery can be used to minimize the amount of code written by developers and instead focus on the functionality of their code. </p>
<p>The book is set for the developer with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript but a jQuery novice. The examples in the first few chapters offer solutions which may be achieved more simply through alternative approaches (e.g. applying styles with JavaScript, rather than applying it directly in HTML), but they serve their purpose of introducing what can be done without introducing a huge amount of features of the library too quickly. The following examples are far more realistic, focusing on tasks more suited to the library. </p>
<p>Each example is explained so thoroughly it includes exploring many eventualities that the less descerning developer may glaze over, with many set over the course of a chapter. I certainly found that many of the examples highlighted problems I just wouldn&#8217;t be aware of. The applications built through the examples include style switchers, animation effects and Chapters 8-9 cover much more completely how to build more full featured scripts such as AJAX based searches, a shopping cart system and image shufflers and rotators. Other topics of note include how to perform manipulation of the DOM tree of a HTML page and how to handle particular event requests. The book also does really well at consistently suggesting in the later examples the must haves of any page featuring JavaScript, progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.</p>
<p>One of the things that frustrated me slightly however was the frequency of code repitition and screen captures for each new added feature, but this is a minor problem considering how well the books covers the subject.</p>
<p>I found this an extremely easy and interesting read, with the example based approach keeping me engaged in how each situation could be enhanced with use of jQuery. The sensible organisation of each chapter means that many asides are covered enough to give the reader a working knowledge of how complementary technologies are able to be used with the library. The book also includes appendices documenting a number of useful web development sites, not all specific to just jQuery. Overall, a thorough introduction to the language.</p>
