      <div class="author_meta">16 Oct 2006</div>

          <p>I was quite impressed with myself the other day that I&#8217;d actually managed to write a bash script within ubuntu which served a purpose. I wanted to be able to monitor the size of files within a particular directory, and report back their size when a change was observed.</p>
<p>I found a program called <a href="http://fileschanged.sourceforge.net">fileschanged</a>, which fulfilled half the problem, namely reporting back a file had changed, but I needed a greater level of detail than that. What it did allow me to do however was pass the filename as an argument (along with some other parameter) to another program. I duely spent an hour or so trying to figure out a script to take that filename and report back its filesize and the current time (which I assume is close enough to that which the file was changed). This is what it looks like:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>
<span class="hljs-shebang">#!/bin/bash</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> [ -z <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$1</span>"</span> ] &amp;&amp; [ -z <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$2</span>"</span> ]; <span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>
    <span class="hljs-built_in">exit</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">fi</span>
FN=<span class="hljs-variable">$2</span>
DATE=$(date +%s)
FILESIZE=$(<span class="hljs-built_in">stat</span> -c%s <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$FN</span>"</span>)
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$DATE</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$FN</span>,<span class="hljs-variable">$FILESIZE</span>"</span></code></pre></div>

      <div class="author_meta">13 Oct 2006</div>

          <p>For the 3rd time I can remember ever I came off my bike this morning. I took a corner too sharply and ended up sliding across the road. So I am currently sitting here with gravel ridden hands and a really sore arse. I thought to go and check my arse when I finally arrived at uni and decided that it might be an idea to find something to stop the injury oozing all over my underwear. Much to the amusement of the staff in reception who commented that they&#8217;d be able to help me apply first aid, but both of them would need to attend as they were of the opposite sex. I decided to go ahead and apply it myself. A wound dressing might be slightly overkill, but hopefully more comfortable when I return home.</p>
<p>It hurts.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been following a number of so called &#8220;web 2.0&#8243; companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It&#8217;s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I&#8217;d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I&#8217;ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I&#8217;d be very interested. I&#8217;m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck&#8230;&#8230;</p>
