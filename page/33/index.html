      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2006</div>

          <p>After the workshop ended in the early hours of the afternoon today, I thought it would be kinda cool to head over and see if I could find threadless in Chicago, to stock up on some more of their awesome t shirts. After a little bit of thinking and umming and ahh-ing about whether or not I could actually find the place, I decided to make a a go of it and try.</p>
<p>A short train ride later, I found the offices of skinnycorp, and got shown round the whole setup, introduced to peeps and given some of those oh so amusing &#8220;i park like an idiot&#8221; stickers. It was kinda surreal to see all these people whole acted as models on the website in real life. Charlie showed me around the place..you can lots of vids of the guy (bearded, glasses, boxed) over at <a href="http://www.craigshimala.com">Craig Shimala&#8217;s</a> web site.</p>
<p>I also got the experience of going to see the whitesox today&#8230;even though they scored 3 home runs, they didn&#8217;t win, but the fireworks at the end were amazing! You can see me, Steve and Paul over on the <a href="http://www.printroom.com/ViewGalleryPhoto.asp?userid=wsfanfoto&#038;gallery_id=377846&#038;image_id=27">sox site</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">05 May 2006</div>

          <p>Hello. Today marked the second day in the workshop I&#8217;m attending and the presentation of some of my own work and thoughts. I&#8217;ve also experienced some very useful thoughts of not only my work, but my PhD as a whole. Today is a good day for that.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening we attended an italian restaurant as part of the evening meals for the conference, which featured such a ridulous amount of food it was stupid. We had less people on our table, and it meant that actually we would end up with more than a dish each &#8211; 1 1/2 plates each full to the brim. Twas nice&#8230;</p>
<p>I also managed to finally get to experience Chicago Downtown pizza, which is something which has to be done apparently. Prior to this also, I managed to get an experience of drinking in a bar looking atop one of the smaller buildings in the area. Have a look at the pic for an idea of what it looked like.</p>

          <p>So today marked the checking in and out of hotels to move down the road in preparation for my workshop I&#8217;m attending while I&#8217;m here. Here&#8217;s some views of my hotel room looking out onto Sears, complete with the only person whom is here with me. I have to head out now, for the conference dinner etc. I shall be sure to post later.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2006/05/03/chicago-day-two-sears-tower-hancock-observatory">Chicago Day Two - Sears Tower, Hancock Observatory</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">03 May 2006</div>

          <p>Today, after yesterdays success, and it being fairly sunny, I decided to try and find Sears Tower (The USA&#8217;s tallest building) and come home fresh in the knowledge I had ascended it. People were all trying to put me off going as the views from Sears weren&#8217;t as good as those from the Hancock observatory, which sits on the Magnificent Mile and gives nice views of the shore of Lake Michigan. I decided, seeing as how it was only $18 total to vist the two, I might as well do that&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I had already been along Michigan Avenue I decided to cut through the various roads cutting across one another to see where I could get to. I stumbled across Chicago&#8217;s Board Of Trade, which has been recommended as a place to visit prior to leaving and numberous other fancy pants buildings, malls and T.J.Maxx (don&#8217;t know why there&#8217;s a difference between J and K from US and UK). When I got to Sears Tower, as I&#8217;d bought tickets prior, I was able to skip queues and head right to the front. After enduring as history lesson and a stupid video in the elevator, ear popping and stupid kids screaming, I was at the top of Sears. The sights were all pretty amazing as I bet you can imagine &#8211; you can have a look at the photo for an idea.</p>
<p>Once I&#8217;d done Sears, I headed off to Hancock, but decided to visit several shops and malls on the way. I had the experience of entering an Apple store which was pretty cool. You can just wonder in and use the internet, listen to music etc etc. Anyway, I carried on. Hancocks intro was a little less well done than Sears, no video, not a lot of staff. Actually security wasn&#8217;t as tight either. *Pause* &#8211; several Fire Engines just have run down the street. The thing I suddenly realised is that the photos they take at the start aren&#8217;t for security, but rather to project the image of at the top of the building (both Sears and Hancock) for purchasing when you come back down. How daft is that?</p>
<p>Views were a little less exciting this time (possibly because I&#8217;d already seen something pretty similar!) but they have the added bonus of a skywalk &#8211; which means its exposed to what you would be able to hear if there was no windows or anything. It was quite a mash of everything going on at once though. The other cool thing was being able to see the stacking of planes coming into what I guess was O Hare airport, like a tiered approach.</p>
<p>After Hancock, I sat around outside drinking a massive smoothie before going into my last mall and realising how late it was. I went past Millenium Park and took a few more photos of the &#8220;jellybean&#8221; in the sun.  </p>

<p>Now however, I am thoroughly tired and my feet kill &#8211; and I have the excitement of my workshop to look forward to tomorrow!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">02 May 2006</div>

          <p>I have an uncanny habit of organising travel on unique dates. Last year my journey to Edinburgh for a conference was held up because it was the day before the G8 summit, when Viv and I went to Dublin, I completely forgot about the fact St Patricks day would fall around that time. My journey to Chicago it would seem is not to be blessed without this feature either. I&#8217;ll let you in on what happened in a sec.</p>
<p>I was still quite out of it when I got up, but thought I&#8217;d make the effort to adjust my body clock. I had to go and hunt for cereal, or a cafe somewhere, was given directions and went to have a look what I could find. I found some rice krispies, which did the job, and scabbed some milk someone else had left.</p>
<p>Anyone whose well up on international news might notice that there have several protests in the US by immigrants who are campaigning against a proposed immigration reform. I heard something about this on the news on the telly as I was wondering what to do with my day, but didn&#8217;t think anything much of it. How silly of me&#8230; </p>
<p>I decided, even though I was pretty darn scared that I should leave the hostel and try and do something with my day &#8211; a trundle across to the Millenium park, and a hunt for some shaving gel was on the agenda, just to see what it looked like. Before I left, I met another guy from Cardiff at the elevators, about two doors down from me. He and his mate were doing a tour across america, and this was there next port of call. I think this may have boosted my confidence to get out of the door. As I got further west, I noticed that there seemed to be rather a lot of police about (the first of whom whizzed by on a boyyed up segway!)</p>
<p>Anyway, I headed over to a fancy fountain, leaving the stack of high-rise buildings for Lake Shore Drive. More and more police (mounted on numerous methods of transport), mexicans and flags appeared. After taking a few pics of the cloudy sky, I headed over to see what the noise was about, stopping next to a news reporter tent. I got to see two news reports about the fact not a lot of people had turned out for this particular rally (did you guess yet?), just before everyone did. For a sec or two, it was a bit crazy, and I had to back out of the park bit I&#8217;d made it to. Apparently estimates put the number up to 400,000 who turned up, I spent about 2hours just watching everyone march about all the closed roads. There&#8217;s lots more on this on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4961734.stm">BBC News website</a>, its currently the top news item on the Americas site&#8230;. (and I have lots of pics too, which I&#8217;ll let people see).</p>
<p>I decided to carry on and had a look around millenium park, and the several bits of strange design it had there (Video Water Fountains and Big Reflective blobs). After that, I walked up Michigan Avenue, looking at the huge number of skyscrapers and general sights, I stopped in a couple of grocery stores and wondered over to where I will be attending my conference later in the week. It&#8217;s right next to NBC tower, so I managed to see the news being presented live inside the building, and the weather reporter (whom I&#8217;d seen earlier) presenting the weather right next to me.  </p>

<p>After that, I went back to Millennium park to sit down for a sec, and had a laugh at the various people who didn&#8217;t realise the vide walls were also fountains (they stop the water when projecting) and therefore ending up legging it every time the water came back on&#8230;..</p>
<p>And now, back to here, stealing wireless from one of the 20 that I&#8217;m able to pick up in the area.</p>
