        Apparently, according to the free English dictionary there is a couple of definitions other than the traditional UK understanding of the word pantomime. For those international readers who don&#8217;t know, a pantomime is a pretty awful example of B-List celebrities acting ability in the UK in which involves them dressing up in bad costumes and acting out a fairy tale or story. In Cardiff, the big panto is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk &#8211; where Jack is played by John Barrowman (or Captain Jack from Torchwood and Dr Who).

        Digg.com is sporting the ability to be able to now rate online video and podcasts. Postcast searching is in limited beta for registered users only.I just spent a while perusing some items of interest, and found a great segment of play! over on google. This just builds on the fact that Mario has the most awesome music ever.The searching of podcasts is dangerously close to an idea I&#8217;ve currently working on myself for a while now.

        Apparently coke isn&#8217;t that good for you &#8211; a few of my friends might like to take heed of that advice. But, you can do some cool things with a lot of it.

        It seems, according to Ben Metcalfe, that Sam Sethi has had his typepad account disabled by Six Apart, rendering him unable to post any updates on his recent departure from TechcrunchUK. Loic Le Meur (Executive Vice President of Six Apart and General Manager of Europe, Middle East and Africa) is currently giving no information about the whole scenario upon his own blog.UPDATE: Apparently Sam Sethi&#8217;s blog is up and running, though he has to yet confirm this and post his take on the whole scenario.

        Techcrunch UK, Techcrunch&#8217;s european sister site has recently had a lot of activiity from some notes which the editor at the time, Sam Sethi made about the recent leweb3 event.This invited some comments from Six Apart’s Loic Le Meur in which he called Sam &#8220;an asshole&#8221;. Sam subsequently posted another blog about the fact that TechcrunchUK would be setting up its own events and workshops in the forthcoming year. It seems this displeased techcrunch&#8217;s Mike Arrington enough to give Sam the boot.

        It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that I posted about coming off of my bike due to a slippery road, but this time was a bit different. Today somebody properly smacked me off of my bike! They were attempting to cut round a light-enabled junction when the lights had gone green in a different direction. As there is a small window of time only 1 or two generally make this turn, but this car decided that it should go even if it wasn&#8217;t its turn.

        Last night I perused a number of articles describing the success of my favourite t-shirt store threadless, the first of which &#8211; over at 37Signals reviews in a positive light and the second in a more negative one.Threadless is a t-shirt company with a difference, it&#8217;s a 24-7 competition allow you to become the designer. Designs are chosen by the team, and are able to be rated by the community that operates around the website.

        I heard about fakeyourspace via mashable today, which offers the ability to purchase your own social networking friends to leave messages and comments on communities such as myspace and facebook (the only two web pages I ever see to be open when supervising university labs). In their own words:*&#8220;If you are tired of seeing everyone else with the hottest friends and want some hotties of your own, then this is the place for you.

        I don&#8217;t really understand microsoft, over the last few days, their live network has been experiencing problems every time I&#8217;ve tried to logon to access my email. Who knows what my 8 emails contain which are hidden within live mail, I certainly don&#8217;t. You would think that more people would be in uproar about this &#8211; I mean what if these were payment requests, final demands or quick response business proposals?

        Registration is open for the Future of Web Apps conference in London 07. I&#8217;d love to go, loads of great companies/people talking (good to see Last.fm making an appearance), loads of schmoozing (if thats the appropriate word), but unfortunately absolutely jack to do with my PhD, so no funding.
