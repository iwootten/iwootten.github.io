          <p>I went round to Living Stones last night for a bit of a lads night with Jon, Dan, Rob and Joe for music and watching Batman Begins. I took a number of Cd&#8217;s for Dan and I to listen to, which basically reflected the &#8220;base&#8221; around which the majority of all my other music stems from. It&#8217;s quite odd trying to verbalise how a particular song makes you feel, why you feel uplifted by it, how it captures a particular moment in time, thought, etc etc. It&#8217;s more odd because I don&#8217;t tend to talk about my music tastes much and coming to terms with what mainstream music means to me is surreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not who we are, but what we do that defines us&#8230;&#8221;</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been attending a fair few &#8216;live&#8217; gigs recently as oppose to the frequenting of clubs in Cardiff. The first was the fantastic <a href="http://www.royksopp.com/">R&ouml;yksopp</a>, whom I was dubious to see alone, but glad I did. Quite frankly they were as great live as I could possibly hope for and the addition of the huge inflatable tape and scrolling info about each song added to the experience.</p>
<p>More recently, I got to see <a href="http://www.bowlingforsoup.com">&#8220;Bowling for Soup&#8221;</a> at union on Friday, which allowed me to experience the &#8216;delights&#8217; of teen punk as well as some awful &#8220;post-punk laptop (c)rap&#8221; from <a href="http://www.mclars.com">Mc Lars</a> who seemed confused as to where exactly Cardiff featured in the UK. When <a href="http://www.americanhi-fi.com/">American Hi-Fi</a> landed as support, the kiddies got a tad excited and decided to vent their frustrations of the last week before half-term by forming a number of mosh pits and jumping into one another. Not fully understanding this myself, we backed off to safer havens and observed further stupidity from there.</p>
<p>Saturday was a return to old pastures for me, providing a warm-up for <a href="http://www.todah.co.uk/2005/">Todah</a>, who are as great live as their website suggests. The venue (the old apostolic church in swansea), was highly unique allowing me to play in the most random room ever as the youth were crammed in like sardines. It was great fun, reminding me of the older youth events we used to hold in Yeovil prior to the move into the new building. It was also awesome to get paid to perform and enjoy worship. I decided to give Heledd a buzz whilst I was there (possibly a little belated I realise) and we ended up going for a fab Indian with the band after, with much laughter involved. Unfortunately it seems some CV&#8217;ers might have inferred a little too much from the outing, (big stick, wrong end), but to be fair it&#8217;s nice to know that people pay enough of an interest in my life to be bothered by that.</p>

          <p>I found a wicked animation by Maria Claudia Cortes describing what personalities a bunch of colours are often attributed with. I reckon I&#8217;m a mixture of red and blue, my wardrobe reflects this as well. <a href="http://www.mariaclaudiacortes.com/">What colour are you?</a></p>

          <p>Whats the most annoying thing ebuyer could leave out of my order for my building a new PC? That&#8217;s it &#8211; the OS, so I can build my lovely little machine, but not actually use the thing until they get their act together. Nice one guys, you <a href="http://www.ebuyersucks.com">suck ass</a>.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve always bought lots of music. Those of you who&#8217;ve had the privilege of viewing my collection will have seen it spans all manner of media, Tape, CD, MD, Vinyl. I&#8217;ve recently been doing a lot of random browsing on ebay for CD&#8217;s that have previously escaped me and possibly buying a few other items from the same seller to save on postage. My biggest one though has to be my most recent, 12 albums from the same seller. It&#8217;s allowed me to reminice the awesome Orb, along with Orbital, Goldie and earlier William Orbit albums whilst exploring a bunch of cheesy trance as well. All for the bargain price of &pound;17! &#8211; a sum which I may have paid for a single album in the past. My how times change&#8230;</p>
<p>My latest favourite ol&#8217; electronica hit as a result is &#8220;Orb &#8211; Little Fluffy Clouds&#8221;.</p>
