          <p>Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, you&#8217;ll realise that there&#8217;s an uprising against paypal amongst developers. Most of this stems from the multitude of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/paypal-to-regretsy-sorry-_n_1132679.html">crazy requirements</a> they put upon sellers and the locks they can put upon your account without notice.</p>
<p>This in part has led to a number of payment alternatives cropping up. Here in the UK for instance, you have Google checkout and checkout by Amazon pitching up against paypal. None of these solutions are ideal though if you&#8217;re looking to make say, a service that bills on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Enter the subscription billing tools &#8211; there&#8217;s <a href="http://recurly.com/">recurly</a>, <a href="http://chargify.com/">Chargify</a> and <a href="http://saasy.com/">Saasy</a>, to name 3. All of these go some way to ease the management of customer subscriptions. This is great if you have an established banking history as a business and are able to get hold of a merchant account. Not so great for me &#8211; an independent developer with neither of those.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, a full-stack payment processor for developers which has no requirement on merchant accounts or gateways. Integration with your own website is as simple as pasting in some javascript. Sounds great&#8230;..Except I need to be in the US to use it. *Facepalm*. I even had beta access to stripe in it&#8217;s infancy and just had to smile at my invitation code.</p>
<p>Recently here in the UK, <a href="http://gocardless.com">Go Cardless</a> has appeared with an interesting model, based around the use of direct debits to set up subscriptions and make payments. That strikes me as a little weird from a customer point of view. I&#8217;m ok paying my gas by direct debit, but would I be ok paying for a piece of software? Given it&#8217;s unusual for a website to bill this way, I&#8217;d argue most people wouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for us independent developers in the UK, Go Cardless really is our best option until Stripe or some other full stack offering lands here. I know Stripe are supposedly working hard on doing so, but payments are at an incredibly frustrating point here right now.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">23 Jan 2012</div>

          <p>Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for <a href="http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures 2012</a>. I&#8217;d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn&#8217;t miss a thing.</p>
<p>Colly and his team had done a lovely job of organising enough to keep us busy what with bowling, screenprinting, fr00tball, the after party and of course the main event.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small.jpg"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="The Albert Hall" width="640" height="480" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515" /></a></p>
<p>Despite not actually branding myself as a web designer, it was great to feel welcomed and able to chat one on one with others about our day to day work. Dan Mall&#8217;s talked helped somewhat here, forcing introductions with everyone around me. I&#8217;m pretty much work in solitary confinement as a developer and to discuss the thoughts and ideas I have with other like minded creatives is always welcome.</p>
<p>During a dinner following the conference, another dev commented that the most of the presentations weren&#8217;t specific to web design. They were in fact so abstract, that it was more a &#8220;Self Help Class for Web Designers&#8221;. I pretty much agree with this. But that&#8217;s with a caveat &#8211; what else do you attend these presentations for? NA Conf is there to share, inspire and enable designers to be better designers. I want to leave giddy eyed with possibilities. Remember there are workshops too for specifics&#8230;</p>
<p>After the whole conference, I feel like there&#8217;s a whole lot more I could do to better myself at my craft. Hopefully over the course of the year I&#8217;ll do something about it. Most of the notes I made are to this effect too and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll take away something different each time I look at them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only so much that can be covered in 45 mins, and for me I want to see a speaker paint me the big picture. After NAConf, I&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of big pictures to get through.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">12 Jan 2012</div>

          <p>I just sent the following email to 1 &#038; 1&#8242;s billing department. I&#8217;ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.</p>
<p>As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We contacted you regarding a declined payment or an expired credit/debit card and have not yet heard back from you.<br>Our records indicate that there is an unpaid balance in your 1&#038;1 customer account no.: K####### as listed below.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly &#8211; No you didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Secondly &#8211; It would be far more useful telling me which domain name in my account a payment demand is in reference to rather than my account number, as I have more than 1 domain with you.</p>
<p>Thirdly &#8211; The steps you&#8217;ve listed here to find my payment details miss steps and references links that don&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Fourthly &#8211; Threatening action when you haven&#8217;t actually sent a primary payment request email is rude, forceful and obnoxious.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please be aware that if this matter is not resolved, you may be sent to a debt collection agency. If the account is sent to a debt collection agency a Â£15.00 &gt; charge will be added to the unpaid balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve decided to take all of my business elsewhere at the earliest opportunity. I&#8217;d hope you&#8217;d take heed of these comments and pay your other longstanding customers the respect they deserve.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2011/11/02/pagination-in-couchdb-apps">Pagination in CouchDB Apps</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">02 Nov 2011</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been working on some fun little node.js / couchdb projects of late. Given the fact I don&#8217;t use either as part of my work, I&#8217;ve spent some downtime experimenting and slowly iterating my approaches as I learn best practice.</p>
<p>I hit what I consider to be a fairly frustrating hurdle that couchdb threw up that I&#8217;ve been blissfully unaware of through all my couchdb dev. When it came to doing pagination it turns out <a href="http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/recipes.html#pagination" title="CouchDB Pagination Recipe">I&#8217;ve always been doing it the &#8220;bad&#8221; way</a>. Oh, well that&#8217;s upsetting.</p>
<h2 id="the-wrong-way">The Wrong Way</h2>
<p>My &#8220;slow&#8221; approach has always been to take the page no as a argument in the url, generating &#8220;skip&#8221; and &#8220;limit&#8221; variables to be used as parameters to my store. So for example, if I wanted to have the 2nd page of my app showing 10 items:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='javascript'>  <span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> skip = (pageno==<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) ? () : ((pageno-<span class="hljs-number">1</span>) * <span class="hljs-number">10</span>);</code></pre></div><div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>  curl -X GET http://<span class="hljs-number">127.0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">0.1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">5984</span>/stuff/_design/stuff/_view/by-name?skip=<span class="hljs-number">10</span>&amp;<span class="hljs-built_in">limit</span>=<span class="hljs-number">10</span></code></pre></div><p>It turns out, that although you might think you&#8217;re starting at a particular result, CouchDB still starts at the first result, due to the way the view is created from the b-tree index, couchDB just surpresses the results you skip. This isn&#8217;t good news when you&#8217;re trying to skip say, 10000 results.</p>
<h2 id="the-suggested-way">The Suggested Way</h2>
<p>The suggested solution is to perform requests and instead of using a &#8220;skip&#8221; parameter, keep track of the startkey at which the next page begins. This is possible, by requesting a page 1 item longer than that of the number of items on a page and using the key of the result in any requests. So now, for a first page my query is:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>  curl -X GET http://<span class="hljs-number">127.0</span>.<span class="hljs-number">0.1</span>:<span class="hljs-number">5984</span>/stuff/_design/stuff/_view/by-name?<span class="hljs-built_in">limit</span>=<span class="hljs-number">11</span></code></pre></div><p>Returning something like:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='json'> {"<span class="hljs-attribute">total_rows</span>":<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">17</span></span>,"<span class="hljs-attribute">offset</span>":<span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>,"<span class="hljs-attribute">rows</span>":<span class="hljs-value">[

If we have duplicate keys, it is also neccessary to keep tabs on the last document&#8217;s id and supply as a startkey_docid arg in order to correctly page through everything.</p>
<p>What personally I dislike about the suggested approach, is the inability to create simple requests to arbritrary pages, even with low numbers. We always need to follow a path of links from the first page in order to view particular results. CouchDB&#8217;s response is &#8220;Not even Google is doing that!&#8221;, which is kind of weak to me. I want nice clean urls ala myapp.com/page/2 or myapp.com?page=2.</p>
<p>In fact, such a suggested approach only really allows us to have a single &#8220;more&#8221; type link in order to fetch results. Passing a startkey as part of a url param eg /page/321aeb36e20d62660eb0d03c9fcd27b2 just sounds (and looks) plain nasty and isn&#8217;t very good from a UX point of view for any users we may have.</p>
<p>At the moment, clean tangible page urls (the right way) are only possible using custom middleware. I&#8217;ve yet to find anything suitable for <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a>. I intend to investigate how to cache document keys for low numbered pages as a separate db in order to produce a solution for my current project and I hope to write a later post detailing how I&#8217;ve got on.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">09 Sep 2011</div>

          <p><a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> is a framework for blogging based on the static site generator <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">jekyll</a>. In short jekyll takes markdown and turns it into blog style html ready to be served straight away with Apache whilst Octopress dresses it up nicely with HTML5, responsive layout goodness and gives you a bunch of options for code formatting and the like. A perfect little blogging setup for hackers for those of us who typically won&#8217;t need all the bells and whistles on our blog I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree.</p>
<p>Using Octopress, you&#8217;d typically write your posts in markdown and process them locally. You&#8217;d then have a number of HTML pages to upload to your web server, which would appear no different than any other blog in terms of functionality.</p>
<p>The most interesting thing that coincincides with the creation of jekyll is that it is now possible to serve static websites straight from Amazon S3, meaning that it isn&#8217;t neccessary to have a web server to serve a Octopress blog. I&#8217;ve been playing a little and have been able to serve my own octopress blog which you can see over at <a href="http://www.ianwootten.com">www.ianwootten.com</a>. Here&#8217;s how to do it:</p>
<h2 id="configure-an-s3-bucket-to-act-as-a-website">Configure an S3 Bucket to Act as a Website</h2>
<p>NB: If you want to use your own domain, then you&#8217;re going to need to create an S3 bucket from the AWS Console named the same as your domain (so for me I created a bucket called &#8220;www.ianwootten.com&#8221;. </p>
<p>To configure your bucket as a website, from the AWS Console, select the new bucket and click &#8220;Properties&#8221;. Choose the &#8220;Website&#8221; tab from the box that appears and check &#8220;enabled&#8221; and set the Index document as &#8220;index.html&#8221;. Click &#8220;Save&#8221;. Now move to the &#8220;permissions&#8221; tab and click &#8220;Add bucket policy&#8221;. Enter a policy as below, with &#8220;www.ianwootten.com&#8221; replaced with the name of the bucket you&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve opted not to use your own domain, then that&#8217;s it for S3. Your new bucket website will be available at a combination of the bucket name and the S3 storage location. In my case, this is <a href="http://www.ianwootten.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/">http://www.ianwootten.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/</a>. There&#8217;s a list of endpoints on the &#8220;website endpoints&#8221; page in <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?WebsiteHosting.html">Amazons S3 website docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="configure-dns">Configure DNS</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re wanting to use your own domain, then you&#8217;ll need to visit your domain registraar and edit some DNS entries. In my case, I added a CNAME entry &#8220;www&#8221; pointing to www.ianwootten.com.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. You&#8217;ll need to use a tool like <a href="http://wwwizer.com">wwwizer</a> in order to forward from the root of your domain to the www subdomain. e.g. &#8220;ianwootten.com&#8221; to &#8220;www.ianwootten.com&#8221;. To get that working, you&#8217;ll also need to modify the @ A record and point it to 174.129.25.170. Read this <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/62527/how-to-create-a-cname-for-a-domains-root-name">serverfault post</a> if you&#8217;re interested to know why.</p>
<p>For more info on CNAME configuration and S3 see <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?WebsiteHosting.html">Amazons S3 website docs</a> (Specifically the notes on virtual hosting).</p>
<h2 id="download-octopress-and-write-some-markdown">Download Octopress and write some Markdown</h2>
<p>Having successfully configured Amazon S3 to host your blog, you need to tackle the age old problem of writing some content for it. This was particularly hard for me, given my lack of knowledge about markdown! You may like to take a look at <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">John Grubers explanation of markdown</a> if you&#8217;re suffering like me. The <a href="http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/">Octopress blogging basics</a> gives a good overview of how your new local blogging workflow will work. Essentially new posts are written in the ./_source/posts folder and when <code>rake generate</code> is executed, your entire websites content is output to the ./public folder. You can also run <code>rake preview</code> in order to preview on a local server.</p>
<p>TO publish your blog, it&#8217;s merely a matter of transferring your /public content to the S3 bucket you&#8217;ve generated.</p>
<p>Having done all that you&#8217;ve now no need to run your own server. You&#8217;re still dependent on those that operate at S3, wwwizer and your domain registraar, but you&#8217;ve removed your own from the equation.
