<div class="author_meta">13 Jan 2009</div>
<p>It seems that all I do these days is talk about what’s going on over at <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> and if you’re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I’ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what’s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.</p>

<p>We’re holding our <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com/challenge/fairytales">second design challenge</a> right now and calling for designs based around the concept of a unique twist on a fairy tale. The prize is our biggest ever, at £200 + a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS3 (which was kindly donated by one of F&#038;B’s community!). You have until 15th February to both submit a design and get it voted on by the F&#038;B peeps!</p>

<p>It looks like I’ve also failed to mention over here the winner of our Snowdodgers competition as the amazing <a href="http://www.mistershrew.co.uk">Mister Shrew</a>. The shirts we printed look amazing and you should pick one up now if you haven’t already.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. </p>

<p>We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released. <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Head over to buy one (or more!)</a>.</p>

<div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2008</div>
<p>For people like myself who are fairly erratic at posting regular updates to their blogs, you might do well to pass your eyes over to <a href="http://sweetcron.com">Sweetcron</a>. Sweetcron does very well at pulling your content from other places on the web you may frequent and gathering it altogether in a neat little summary page automatically. This is otherwise known as a lifestream and has gained popularity as people tend toward exposing more of their activities on the web. You can see mine over <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/stream">here</a> (although is mostly twitter updates for the minute).</p>

<p>What sets this lifestream software apart from others is that as its opensource it can be downloaded, modified and hosted upon your own servers. That means you’re free to mess about with it as you like and maybe customise the page in your own snazzy design. It’s also based on the lovely codeigniter PHP framework from the peeps at ellislabs, which I’ve used a number of times now. You’ll need to modify the .htaccess and codeigniter config to get it working in a sub-folder, but it’s all fairly easy and self explanatory. </p>

<p>The author, <a href="http://www.yongfook.com">Yong Fook</a> has done well to put this out as a side project all on his tod. Whilst my design looks fairly basic, there is a more fancy version included that looks a lot like Yongs homepage.</p>

<p>If you’re a proper geek, a <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1202">homebrewed version of a lifestream</a> might be more your style.</p>

<h1><a href="/2008/05/31/cardiff-web-meetup-no-3">Cardiff Web Meetup #3</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">31 May 2008</div>
<p>Just a quick note to remind people that this coming week is the third Cardiff meetup for web types in wales. It’s in 10 Feet Tall on Church St on Wednesday 4th June from 6.30pm. Featured speakers include <a href="http://www.thelondonbiker.com/">Matthew Cashmore</a> (Development Producer for BBC Future Media &#038; Technology, Research and Innovation) and <a href="http://timholmes.blogspot.com/">Tim Holmes</a> (Course co-ordinator for the Postgraduate Diploma in Magazine Journalism and the MA International Journalism: Magazine Pathway at Cardiff University’s School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies). It sounds like its going to be two really interesting talks with Matt discussing BBC Backstage and Mashed, whilst Tim will be chatting about journalism for the web. If thats not enough, there is even bands that you would normally have to pay for on afterwards. </p>

<p>I’m not sure how many visitors have caught this ted talk before, but I’d thought I’d post it anyway. Johnny Chung Lee is amazing, turning a $40 wii remote into use an interactive whiteboard or a new way to interact with video games via head tracking. He’s been at this sort of thing for ages previously putting out a <a href="http://www.littlegreatideas.com/steadycam/">$14 steadycam</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/2008/05/06/fair-and-bare-bringing-design-to-fairtrade">Fair and Bare &#8211; Bringing Design to Fairtrade</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">06 May 2008</div>
<p>Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I’m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with <a href="http://fairdos.com">fairdos</a> and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don’t appeal to us at all. Some of these friends are people who are right up there within prominent fairtrade companies, who although avid promoters, won’t wear fairtrade on a day to day basis if it means they have to sacrifice their style. It seems that the fairtrade companies don’t do design and so we’re not given a choice between two similar products. The end result is we’re faced with looking great and feeling a little discontent that the garment isn’t as fantastic as it could be, or feeling great about a product – but not looking so awesome. We’ve often spoken of beginning a fairtrade company that puts out clothing that is both ethically produced and well designed, but held off doing so because it felt a little beyond us. I can say here now that we’ve made the first step in bringing that vision a little closer.</p>

<p><a href="http://fairandbare.com">Fair and Bare</a> is a crowdsourcing project which pays out comission to designers who successfully produce t shirt design ideas for fairtrade t shirts. It’s also an attempt for the fairtrade community to lose that somewhat ‘serious face’ with which I think they are often associated and relax the shoulders a bit whilst having some fun. We’re currently offering £200 for designs and £50 for design ideas which we think are worth printing up onto fairtrade cotton. We then hope to offer shirts at a somewhat more accessible price than other fairtrade shirts. It’s a fun, small project at the moment, but I hope that we can help rejuvinate an otherwise awesome product and maybe inspire others to do the same.</p>

<h1><a href="/2008/04/02/amazon-associates-wordpress-wishlist-plugin">Amazon Associates WordPress Wishlist Plugin</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">02 Apr 2008</div>
<p>One of the things that’s bugged me for a while whilst having a website is that at certain times of the year when people might actually like to buy me a gift they’re unable to find my wishlist. This is mainly because they’re simple folk who might not think to check amazon for my name. I’m also signed up with amazon associates, so I decided it could do me well to post my wishlist items along with my referral tag in the links in order to earn a bob or two on my own homepage. All this data is available on the web already its just a case of putting it together.</p>

<p>Some keen readers might of noticed the wishlist page I stuck up recently and want something similar on their own site and (like myself) either can’t be bothered or didn’t have the time to create a plugin to pull this data together. I’m putting up here my own quick and dirty plugin I built a few weeks ago to achieve this.</p>

<p>It uses amazon web services to look up a wishlist, stick in a specified associates id in each of my item links and replace where I put the text <!-- wishlist_content --> (without spaces) in a post with my wishlist items. The plugin regularly updates this (hourly) as a scheduled event in wordpress in case someone decides to actually buy me something. Of course you’ll need a services key to use it, which you can easily get by signing up with amazon at aws.amazon.com. Fill out your services id, your wishlist id (found by logging into amazon and heading to your wishlist page) and your locale (the bit after amazon. so mine is .co.uk) and press the fetch items to pull all the items in. If you don’t have an associates id, feel free to leave as my own : )</p>

<p>I used curl to get the remote data from amazon as the file_get_content methods generally aren’t enabled on normal web hosts. If you’d like the items to be fetched less regularly, then install the plugin with and updated wp_schedule_event method in the main wishlist.php to a value of your choice.</p>

<p>You can download it over <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/wishlist.zip">here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Double alliteration in a post title? Not sure I’ve attempted that before.</em></p>

<p>[Edit: You’ll need to be running on PHP5 to make use of this plugin]<br />
[Edit: I released an updated version based on Amazon’s move to use of signitures, see the details <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/10/25/amazon-associates-wordpress-plugin-v0-2">here</a>]</p>

<h1><a href="/2008/01/31/book-review-code-igniter-for-rapid-php-application-development">Book Review: Code Igniter for Rapid PHP Application Development</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">31 Jan 2008</div>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1847191746/staplediet-21"><img src="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/1847191746.02.TZZZZZZZ.jpg" alt="Code Igniter for Rapid PHP Application Development" /></a>In this book, author David Upton walks you through use of the Code Igniter framework, which is essentially PHP&#8217;s answer to Ruby on Rails. I&#8217;ve been a avid user of <a href="http://codeigniter.com">Code Igniter</a> since I discovered it last year, which is a nice waypoint for anyone trying to understand model-view-controller architectures and not wanting to make the move over to ROR quite yet.</p>
<p>The angle of this book is taken from a first time CI developer, but one with some knowledge of both PHP and web development in general. The initial chapters begin by exploring why you&#8217;d choose to use CI and some of its benefits over straight PHP code (such as saving on code reproduction or easing development burdens), though doesn&#8217;t really offer any real comparison of features of other similar frameworks. A traditional chapter on setup of CI is also included, (though I think at 4 pages could have perhaps been merged with another!). </p>
<p>The book then proceeds by tackling the subject at the core of CI, &#8216;model-view-controller&#8217; and how this relates to traditional methods of programming. David breaks down how CI is structured very well and gives suggestions of how applications built within it should be designed to be successful. Some of the example code savings at this stage are somewhat minimal over a standard approach, but I think David conveys how these rack up throughout a web app. Useful chapters of how active record and CRUD can be used to ease DB interaction and also how views can be organised to avoid repitition complete with examples should allow any new CI developer to get to grips with it very quickly.</p>
<p>The later chapters quite extensively cover more &#8220;geeky&#8221; complicated subjects (using objects and namespaces, localisation, getting CI to interact with other services) which might be a bit much for a hobbyist user, but it gives some room for learning for others. The book also includes some good descriptions of how to make the most of the testing and profiling features which CI has out of the box to debug some of the larger web applications that you might undertake (Both features which I&#8217;ve previously been unaware of).</p>
<p>The use of friendly language is a welcome change from other texts, but I think in places it does get in the way a bit of the particular functionality which is being talked about. The constant reenforcement of the MVC throughout will be welcome for new converts, but my own practical experience suggests this might be better bent in places. A number of the descriptions of features provided in the book are at the CI site, and I think what might have helped this book is if a single larger running example led the way to describing each of the features.</p>
<p>At the moment, this is the only CI book available and it does well at covering the large featureset CI has. For a seasoned CI veteran it won&#8217;t bring any revelations, but if you&#8217;re new the framework it will serve you extremely well at getting your head round what makes it shine.</p>
