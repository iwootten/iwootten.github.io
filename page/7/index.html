        Twitter is all over the news at the moment. For the uninitiated, it allows you to list short updates of what you are doing at any time. BBC News seemed to have an all-out assault at the end of January raving about it at every opportunity &#8211; the first moments of the Hudson plane landing, an short chat about it by Stephen Fry on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and this short clip on iPlayer by Stephen Fry again.

        I can&#8217;t help but feel a little sorry for music blogs as of late. I&#8217;m sure you may be familiar with The Hype Machine and may use it on a daily basis. For the uninitiated, it is essentially a music blog aggregator, which takes details of tracks and ranks them based on how often they appear and how popular they are. I&#8217;ve found it really interesting to browse around and discover new artists.

        It has struck me over the last couple of days and it&#8217;s a reflection of my attitude to being interested in geeky things in general. I&#8217;m an elitist. When I started my blog back in 2003, I loved the fact that relatively few of them existed. It was a reflection of my day to day life and I felt my voice was being heard (even though I had no analytics tools to back that up and it was not particularly interesting).

        It seems that all I do these days is talk about what&#8217;s going on over at Fair &#038; Bare and if you&#8217;re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I&#8217;ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what&#8217;s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.

        I&#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. 

We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released.

        Yesterday I announced that we&#8217;re running our first design challenge in conjunction with team Snowdodgers at Fair &#038; Bare. These are some really amazing fellas who are trying to raise £48,000 for charity by rallying a £200 banger round 4000 miles involving the Arctic circle. We&#8217;re asking designers to get in designs relating to the chilly weather and the guys crazy antics!
If you&#8217;re interested, you&#8217;ve got just a month to get an entry in.

        For people like myself who are fairly erratic at posting regular updates to their blogs, you might do well to pass your eyes over to Sweetcron. Sweetcron does very well at pulling your content from other places on the web you may frequent and gathering it altogether in a neat little summary page automatically. This is otherwise known as a lifestream and has gained popularity as people tend toward exposing more of their activities on the web.

Thanks to everyone who&#8217;s participated since we kicked off. Really appreciate all your designs, words and support. We&#8217;re still taking submissions for our competitions, so if you haven&#8217;t hit us up already make sure you do!

        Just a quick note to remind people that this coming week is the third Cardiff meetup for web types in wales. It&#8217;s in 10 Feet Tall on Church St on Wednesday 4th June from 6.30pm. Featured speakers include Matthew Cashmore (Development Producer for BBC Future Media &#038; Technology, Research and Innovation) and Tim Holmes (Course co-ordinator for the Postgraduate Diploma in Magazine Journalism and the MA International Journalism: Magazine Pathway at Cardiff University&#8217;s School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies).

        I&#8217;m not sure how many visitors have caught this ted talk before, but I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d post it anyway. Johnny Chung Lee is amazing, turning a $40 wii remote into use an interactive whiteboard or a new way to interact with video games via head tracking. He&#8217;s been at this sort of thing for ages previously putting out a $14 steadycam.
