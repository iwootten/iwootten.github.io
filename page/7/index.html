        In order for me to generate this post I&#8217;ve created something quite novel on my blog &#8211; a new category which I&#8217;ve not had a great deal of experience in previously, &#8220;work&#8221;. For the last couple of months I&#8217;ve been working for Aardman features in Bristol on their forthcoming feature film, &#8220;Pirates&#8221; &#8211; building software, which I&#8217;ll be doing at least for the next couple of months too.
I&#8217;ve been having an amazing experience over this time.

        I don&#8217;t particularly like using URL shortening services. I think I first noticed them getting used rather prolificly in the Guardians technology section to include lots of random links to bizarre web content. TinyURL&#8217;s own web site wouldn&#8217;t particularly inspire me to go ahead and make use of it either. But, because of my own use of services such as twitter, I&#8217;m forced to shrink down links to get within those 144 characters.

        I&#8217;ve been looking back at the posts on this site and the commitment that I supposedly made (internally) a couple of months ago about posting regular, interesting content. But it seemed to die a death very promptly.
I think that there may be a bit of a vicious circle here (in my own situation at least). I&#8217;d love to post regular interesting stuff, but for that to happen I need to feel that it might be read.

        I&#8217;ve been pondering this morning how the use of the internet has (or may have) changed my life. As a child/teen during the web&#8217;s infancy, I was blissfully unaware that so many lifes/careers/relationships would be enabled or changed as a result of the interactions it might facilitate. I hadn&#8217;t even heard of google prior to arriving at university and two years prior to that had never had internet access anywhere locally.

        Twitter is all over the news at the moment. For the uninitiated, it allows you to list short updates of what you are doing at any time. BBC News seemed to have an all-out assault at the end of January raving about it at every opportunity &#8211; the first moments of the Hudson plane landing, an short chat about it by Stephen Fry on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and this short clip on iPlayer by Stephen Fry again.

        I can&#8217;t help but feel a little sorry for music blogs as of late. I&#8217;m sure you may be familiar with The Hype Machine and may use it on a daily basis. For the uninitiated, it is essentially a music blog aggregator, which takes details of tracks and ranks them based on how often they appear and how popular they are. I&#8217;ve found it really interesting to browse around and discover new artists.

        It has struck me over the last couple of days and it&#8217;s a reflection of my attitude to being interested in geeky things in general. I&#8217;m an elitist. When I started my blog back in 2003, I loved the fact that relatively few of them existed. It was a reflection of my day to day life and I felt my voice was being heard (even though I had no analytics tools to back that up and it was not particularly interesting).

        It seems that all I do these days is talk about what&#8217;s going on over at Fair &#038; Bare and if you&#8217;re here because you prefer the more geeky side to me I apologise I&#8217;ve not been indulging you recently. However, that said, these posts do represent a significant part of me right now and what&#8217;s going on in my life so I think it fair I shout about it.

        I&#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. 

We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released.

        Yesterday I announced that we&#8217;re running our first design challenge in conjunction with team Snowdodgers at Fair &#038; Bare. These are some really amazing fellas who are trying to raise £48,000 for charity by rallying a £200 banger round 4000 miles involving the Arctic circle. We&#8217;re asking designers to get in designs relating to the chilly weather and the guys crazy antics!
If you&#8217;re interested, you&#8217;ve got just a month to get an entry in.
