      <div class="author_meta">19 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I was inspired yesterday by watching a few vids on the internet of <a href="http://www.unicyclejester.com/video.php">crazy kids</a> doing trials unicycling, so decided to go out for a ride in the evening round Roath Park. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve ridden, but it seems you don&#8217;t forget. Nor do the &#8216;oh I&#8217;m original&#8217; taunts cease, such as &#8220;oi, mate, you&#8217;ve lost a wheel!&#8221;, &#8220;pull a wheelie!&#8221; etc etc. Anyway, it was nice to finally ride mine without fear of the horrid scratching which I usually obtain from my previous saddle. Alas I think it&#8217;ll be a long time before I&#8217;m able to perform smooth grinds along benches and the like.</p>
<p>Apparently, I&#8217;ve heard in Japan where unicycling was invented, trials unicycling is as popular a sport as mountain biking, but I don&#8217;t believe this for a minute as I&#8217;ve never seen any evidence. I was also wondering what the policy on unicycling upon pavements was&#8230;people don&#8217;t seem to mind, seem more bemused than anything and move out of the way. </p>
<p>If anyones interested, they can have a <a href="http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mepgjdf/ftt/day1.html">look</a> at the Land&#8217;s End to John O&#8217;Groats record that my mates broke, 5 years ago. I believe today would be the anniversary of Jay wrecking his van.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">17 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I went back home this weekend for <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Wootten/gallery/folder/Weddings/Tim%20n%20Becca%20-%202005-08-13" title="Pic&#39;s">Tim and Becca&#8217;s</a> wedding. Although the weather didn&#8217;t hold out &#8211; it was raining all day, the guys made the most of it and the service was fab. Music was provided by Mr Maynard and a string quartet. By far the most amusing thing was the pastor&#8217;s inability to use a radio mike without whispering the whole service. So amusing sentences like &#8220;Don&#8217;t fall down the steps&#8230;.like you did yesterday&#8221; abounded. </p>
<p>The evening ceremonies &#8211; a barn dance and a whole ice-cream cabinet full of sweet&#8217;s (which I duely explored without instruction &#8211; insighting a bit of a riot!), were held at the Haynes motor museum, which I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been too despite it being upon my doorstep. This was quite cool as it gave us something intersting to look at whilst wondering about. One of the cadillilacs was almost the exact same model I won (though a year older). If it had been the same car I think I would&#8217;ve been a tad annoyed as we offered it to them when I won it. Anyway, it was great to catch up with everyone, old faces (my old neighbours!) and see the Yeovil crew.</p>
<p>The weather improved loads the following day &#8211; so I made the most of it and drove out to ham hill. It&#8217;s changed loads since I went out there last so was a bit confused to find the quarry somewhere else to where it used to be. Anyway, I stayed out there as the sun set and took a couple of pictures. It&#8217;s a really beautiful place as you can no doubt see, and holds many fond childhood memories.</p>

          <p>I went to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night &#8211; which I thought was great, compared to the original preconceptions I had of it from trailers, reviews and the like. Anyways, I was sat there at the end as all the children were walking out of the factory thinking, &#8220;Well, at least I&#8217;m not as thin as Mike TV&#8221;.</p>

          <p>So, after renewing my insurance policy today, I get handed the piece of paper with my policy number and the words &#8220;Ashley, love&#8221;. I&#8217;m unsure whether the guy wrote this in awe of myself or indeed it had been written previously on the pad in use. Either way, the words in that order don&#8217;t make any sense. Dyslexia perhaps? There&#8217;s been a bit of talk and reading recently involving dating with integrity, not settling with second best and the like, but this ranks a few rungs below that upon my ladder unfortunately.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">03 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>On a lighter note, I went to a &#8216;focus group&#8217; last night which was fairly surreal. I&#8217;d been asked last week to attend, and had agreed not actually knowing the subject matter. On sunday I was informed that it was going to be on &#8216;mens cosmetics&#8217; (something I&#8217;m obviously very familiar with!) so didn&#8217;t really know what to expect. After arriving, discovering two of my old coursemates were there (and on the same course as Garima), we sat down for like 45 minutes talking about our opinions about luxuries, cosmetics and as many tangents we could stray off on as possible. It was all fairly amusing, except for the part where I was forced to admit to moisturising in front of a bunch of guys I&#8217;d just met&#8230;(I get really dry skin!)..</p>
<p>What it did leave me thinking was the whole aspect of image and how we can become overly concerned with it. Most of you who know me know that I&#8217;m not overly bothered with combo&#8217;s of clothing, I tend to buy on the off chance and whatever is suitable and cheapest. What I am a little more concerned about is my build, but only because people generally comment to me in disdain due to how thin I am. For all those people, I&#8217;m really sorry that you seem to have a problem with this, feeling the need to bring it up all the time. I am what I am, God made me this way, I can&#8217;t help high metabolism, its not my fault, leave it out!&#8230;..really I&#8217;m sure you wouldn&#8217;t want to be blessed with such a skinny, lanky, body &#8211; I&#8217;ve had health problems in the past because of it and not the eating disorder kind either. I could understand desire for the tall, dark, handsome, intelligent, humourous, modest angle, but not the lankiness..</p>
<p>Hmm, tangents again, so much for the &#8216;lighter note&#8217;.</p>
