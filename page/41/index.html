      <div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj&#8217;ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe&#8217;s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I&#8217;m a bit out of practice. </p>
<p>Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band <a href="http://www.walkingwounded.co.uk">&#8220;Walking Wounded&#8221;</a> all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support). One of the conversations I had while I was there was with the infamous Carl (who was playing some crazy dub and reggae), revealing the sad news that Fridays <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com">&#8220;off the shelf&#8221;</a> at BSB is to come to an end. Its a bit of a shame, the guys had a great set-up there, gave me the odd gig offer now and then and I&#8217;ve met a fair few randoms through events they&#8217;ve put on, always enjoying it due to all the guys having a sound appreciation of good music. So long&#8230;</p>
<p>An afterparty from Zoe&#8217;s meant a bit of a late one on Friday, although a night absolutely chocka of funky soul, breaks and beats from full-fat at Moloko&#8217;s. It was a great night, great music and a great change to be making such a trip with a posse rather than being a loner. The same can be said of last night, due to the trip over to Bristol for Jurassic 5&#8242;s performance. Although <a href="http://www.cutchemist.com">Cut Chemist</a> wasn&#8217;t there, Numark absolutely rocked the place with the solo&#8217;s he&#8217;d put together, with one crazy &#8220;do-wop&#8221; solo. It was fab to finally see him in action, after all the vids I&#8217;ve watched of him with Chemist and DJ Shadow. I stunk so much of weed when I returned it was disgusting.</p>
<p>Anyway, seems I&#8217;ve been inspired to check out a few random artists on Warp, namely Brothemstates (did the music for the Sprite ad) and the Rip Off Artist from Kid 606&#8242;s Tigerbeat Label. I also ordered the KEEPINTIME dvd off ninjatune by, er, pretty much everyone :). <a href="http://www.warprecords.com">Warp</a> and <a href="http://www.ninjatune.net">Ninjatune</a> are both having sales of sorts at the moment if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">25 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been having some really random dreams this week, the strangest part being I can actually remember them. Here&#8217;s a few examples:</p>
<p>Sunday &#8211; I had one of those ones where, you&#8217;re aware you&#8217;re asleep and can control whats going on, but was face down on my bed and completely overcome by something and unable to move any part of my body. When I woke up, with a bit of a start, I&#8217;d only been out for a half hour.</p>
<p>Monday &#8211; I dreamt I was down the beach somewhere in Cornwall, an absolutely beautiful place it was, when a huge tidal wave comes crashing in. Everyone legs it, leaving all their belongings. In the aftermath, I return searching through all the debri, which contains a high volume of digital cameras. I&#8217;m unable to recover my own, and am instead just left with the case.</p>
<p>Tuesday &#8211; In this dream I seem to be visiting the cinema where, for some reason, they&#8217;re selling hugely discounted bags of popcorn (&pound;100 -&gt; &pound;0.75!). They are massive bags and although really rather tempted by them, I decide to pass as I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to share the immense amount of popcorn they contain with anyone before it begins to taste stale.</p>
<p>Like I said, pretty bizarre.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2005/08/19/trials-unicycling">Trials Unicycling</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">19 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I was inspired yesterday by watching a few vids on the internet of <a href="http://www.unicyclejester.com/video.php">crazy kids</a> doing trials unicycling, so decided to go out for a ride in the evening round Roath Park. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve ridden, but it seems you don&#8217;t forget. Nor do the &#8216;oh I&#8217;m original&#8217; taunts cease, such as &#8220;oi, mate, you&#8217;ve lost a wheel!&#8221;, &#8220;pull a wheelie!&#8221; etc etc. Anyway, it was nice to finally ride mine without fear of the horrid scratching which I usually obtain from my previous saddle. Alas I think it&#8217;ll be a long time before I&#8217;m able to perform smooth grinds along benches and the like.</p>
<p>Apparently, I&#8217;ve heard in Japan where unicycling was invented, trials unicycling is as popular a sport as mountain biking, but I don&#8217;t believe this for a minute as I&#8217;ve never seen any evidence. I was also wondering what the policy on unicycling upon pavements was&#8230;people don&#8217;t seem to mind, seem more bemused than anything and move out of the way. </p>
<p>If anyones interested, they can have a <a href="http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mepgjdf/ftt/day1.html">look</a> at the Land&#8217;s End to John O&#8217;Groats record that my mates broke, 5 years ago. I believe today would be the anniversary of Jay wrecking his van.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">17 Aug 2005</div>

          <p>I went back home this weekend for <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Wootten/gallery/folder/Weddings/Tim%20n%20Becca%20-%202005-08-13" title="Pic&#39;s">Tim and Becca&#8217;s</a> wedding. Although the weather didn&#8217;t hold out &#8211; it was raining all day, the guys made the most of it and the service was fab. Music was provided by Mr Maynard and a string quartet. By far the most amusing thing was the pastor&#8217;s inability to use a radio mike without whispering the whole service. So amusing sentences like &#8220;Don&#8217;t fall down the steps&#8230;.like you did yesterday&#8221; abounded. </p>
<p>The evening ceremonies &#8211; a barn dance and a whole ice-cream cabinet full of sweet&#8217;s (which I duely explored without instruction &#8211; insighting a bit of a riot!), were held at the Haynes motor museum, which I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever been too despite it being upon my doorstep. This was quite cool as it gave us something intersting to look at whilst wondering about. One of the cadillilacs was almost the exact same model I won (though a year older). If it had been the same car I think I would&#8217;ve been a tad annoyed as we offered it to them when I won it. Anyway, it was great to catch up with everyone, old faces (my old neighbours!) and see the Yeovil crew.</p>
<p>The weather improved loads the following day &#8211; so I made the most of it and drove out to ham hill. It&#8217;s changed loads since I went out there last so was a bit confused to find the quarry somewhere else to where it used to be. Anyway, I stayed out there as the sun set and took a couple of pictures. It&#8217;s a really beautiful place as you can no doubt see, and holds many fond childhood memories.</p>

          <p>I went to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night &#8211; which I thought was great, compared to the original preconceptions I had of it from trailers, reviews and the like. Anyways, I was sat there at the end as all the children were walking out of the factory thinking, &#8220;Well, at least I&#8217;m not as thin as Mike TV&#8221;.</p>
