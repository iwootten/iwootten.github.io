          <p>Woohoo, rock on &#8211; its almost holiday season for me. Next week I&#8217;ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh&#8230;Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I&#8217;ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who&#8217;ll be there with me &#8211; you best make it a good&#8217;n.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Jun 2006</div>

          <p>Currently, I&#8217;ve been spending many an hour pondering domain name choices for a fair trade t-shirt site I&#8217;d like to set-up, but never actually committing to one, due to the rather lacklustre responses of others on hearing my suggestions, or not finding anything suitable which conveys what I am trying to get across (a hip, trendy t-shirt place, ala <a href="http://www.threadless.com" title="Threadless">threadless.com</a>).If anyone can think of anything clever &#8211; let me know.</p>

          <p>Interestingly, two of my most used sites hotmail and ebay, seem to be unavailable at the moment for me to peruse in my daily late night browsing routine. Maybe ntl is doing something stupid at the moment, in fact this is most likely the problem as large amounts of images around the web are unable to be displayed for one reason or another.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">22 May 2006</div>

          <p>So I managed to make it to the zoo yesterday, which was very exciting. More exciting though, was the night safari, where everything is minimally lit with the animals there to give a night time experience (I expect). I was a bit worried about catching buses and the like, but it was fine in the end, everything was really very well laid out, it was a doddle.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m off to visit the somewhat artificial Sentosa island &#8211; there seems to be a bit of controversy about the fact the land is all &#8216;reclaimed&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway, just a short blog (I&#8217;m being timed) to let you know whats going down in Singapore.</p>
<p>Catch up with you all later,</p>
<p>Ian</p>

      <div class="author_meta">19 May 2006</div>

          <p>I’ve just returned from the conference dinner to finalise CCGRID for ’06. Tomorrow will be its last day whereupon everyone will return to their various different countries, or maybe somewhere closer for a short time on holiday. I’ve already heard of others plans to see Malaysia and Vietnam. I’ll be here until Tuesday evening to check out all that Singapore has to offer (at least I hope I will be able to).</p>
<p>Tonight’s meal was very crazy, lots of food that I wouldn’t normally eat, but I seemed to manage all 8 courses without too much trouble. Shark soup, chickens with their heads still on and lots of beer and tea were all on the menu. There was also some crazy dancing which went on between about course 6/7.</p>
<p>I’m getting a little more used to the layout of everything so far in the university, but it’s so spread out and the buildings are so similar it’s still pretty confusing. </p>
<p>I’ll get to explore the use of the MRT more than previously from tomorrow, and to explore some slightly more diverse areas I guess, with much photo taking. This includes the now infamous Orchard Road everyone has been talking about, as I have been unable to reach it previously, hopefully a few cheapo gadgets may catch my eye. I’d also like to go to the night zoo, but this is a bit awkward as it runs late at night and the last bus connection to it is fairly early in comparison in the evening. Annoying. Today is also my last day with definite internet access, so I may not post any updates until when I return afterwards. Sorry about that, especially if you’re anyone who may be even missing me.</p>
