          <p>So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).</p>
<p>Then theres that other little thing, of my engagement to Viv, which is extremely exciting. We snuck off together to climb the hill during the afternoon and returned engaged seeing if anyone would notice the ring upon Vivs finger. Oh the children we are. She&#8217;d kind of seen it coming, but was still a little taken aback that it was happening for real I think. While I don&#8217;t know what the future holds for either of us, I do know that I want to spend it together.  </p>

          <p>Woohoo, rock on &#8211; its almost holiday season for me. Next week I&#8217;ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh&#8230;Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I&#8217;ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who&#8217;ll be there with me &#8211; you best make it a good&#8217;n.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Jun 2006</div>

          <p>Currently, I&#8217;ve been spending many an hour pondering domain name choices for a fair trade t-shirt site I&#8217;d like to set-up, but never actually committing to one, due to the rather lacklustre responses of others on hearing my suggestions, or not finding anything suitable which conveys what I am trying to get across (a hip, trendy t-shirt place, ala <a href="http://www.threadless.com" title="Threadless">threadless.com</a>).If anyone can think of anything clever &#8211; let me know.</p>

          <p>Interestingly, two of my most used sites hotmail and ebay, seem to be unavailable at the moment for me to peruse in my daily late night browsing routine. Maybe ntl is doing something stupid at the moment, in fact this is most likely the problem as large amounts of images around the web are unable to be displayed for one reason or another.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">22 May 2006</div>

          <p>So I managed to make it to the zoo yesterday, which was very exciting. More exciting though, was the night safari, where everything is minimally lit with the animals there to give a night time experience (I expect). I was a bit worried about catching buses and the like, but it was fine in the end, everything was really very well laid out, it was a doddle.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m off to visit the somewhat artificial Sentosa island &#8211; there seems to be a bit of controversy about the fact the land is all &#8216;reclaimed&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway, just a short blog (I&#8217;m being timed) to let you know whats going down in Singapore.</p>
<p>Catch up with you all later,</p>
<p>Ian</p>
