<h1><a href="/2005/04/27/hitch-hikers-guide-to-the-skittle-alley">Hitch Hikers Guide to the Skittle Alley</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">27 Apr 2005</div>
<p>Every time I visit UGC Cardiff it brings back terrible memories of when I went to see ‘Matrix Revolutions’ last year. A bit psyched by the fact that it may of be able to redeem the tragedy which was ‘Matrix Reloaded’, I went to see it with some of the Glamorgan crew on its day of release. All was going as well as could be expected, until when 3/4 way through we were treated to a bit of a fight sequence and aerial acrobatics, which didn’t really seem to fit with what we had been watching, but could of been some sort of trendy ‘dream sequence’. It became a bit clearer after 30 seconds or so of this show that this really didn’t make any sense and in fact when people started breaking through walls, talking backwards and walking upside down it was downright obvious what had happened. However, we were subjected to a further 1-2 mins of it before anyone bothered to sort it out, which took 20 or so minutes. Obviously we already knew what was going to happen when the scene was finally shown – we knew it back to front (ho ho). It’s just as well the film was rubbish or else I would of been really annoyed.</p>

<p>This evening however was a good experience at UGC, there’s a first. I went along to an advance screening of ‘The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy’ with Jon, Cathy and Katie. Keeping true to the original radio show, book and tv show’s got to be a hard job by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it was pulled off rather well. I like the way that we expanded on what we knew of the Vogon’s (“You’re supposed to Stop!”) and revealing Deep Thought was a bit of a couch potato, this always appeals. Marvin was also fantastic – though I disagree with the fact that some people seem to think he was under-used, anything more would of been too much. Admittedly it did feel a bit crammed and I agree that if you hadn’t read, heard or seen any of Adams’ stuff before you would probably be fairly lost. I wish in fact I hadn’t read the book so recently, it spoilt so much of the film as a lot of the script was word for word from it.</p>

<p>After this I went off for a housegroup social in the Crwys’s skittle alley..which was ever so slightly disappointing. I spent five minutes in the pub trying to find it (which involved pretending I needed the loo), as it was absolutely rammed to the brim. I guess I need to play it with mates back home who enjoy the more vicious version whereby throwing balls is permitted when skittles are being arranged or the balls are still being placed in the other end of the run. Much more exciting….</p>

<div class="author_meta">22 Apr 2005</div>
<p>Having free time in the evenings recently is a wonderful thing, and its given me the chance to think about ‘stuff’ I might not of done otherwise, recently its been my undergrad life. When I came to University, I was all fired up for an amazing walk through Christendom, I tried to throw myself into the Christian Union, and for a while it was great. Unfortunately my work got a grip of me very quickly, and for all the wrong reasons I backed off from CU and any kind of fellowship with others. I didn’t really settle at any Church well here and the year I spent at home made it even worse by becoming more disjointed from my Cardiff life….</p>

<p>I got my degree, and a good one at that, but I can’t help but think I put myself through hell (this time last year was awful for me) for absolutely zero benefit over what could have been. I know I’ve been taken down this path for a reason and while I might think there wasn’t anything going on, the whole experience is a lesson in discipline in itself.</p>

<p>Changing churches and attending a housegroup this year has been great, I’ve made some fantastic friends and its pushed me forward in ways I wouldn’t of thought possible, building me (and I hope others) up with far more on the horizon. Anyway, suffice to say reflecting on this hasn’t been great for me this week, but I’ve also felt encouraged by a few words I’ve been given of late about my character…trying to be a little more confident and forthcoming about my feelings, due to my unique slant on the world.</p>

<p>I’ve been running around a bit like a headless chicken recently, not content with spending lots of time at uni working, I’ve been partying pretty hard as well. </p>

<p>Spent Friday going to Kez’s 21st birthday for a meal at Old Orleans, which was rather tasty. Bombed back to hang out with Vineyardites at Marty’z Kitchen, which we were duely moved on from to Cafe aroma, and back to mine (after a few choice insults were uttered by me) for a nice cuppa. After that, decided to go on to Sumo at the Welsh club with Aquasky and Masterblaster, once again having a fab time on my own and dancing about like a loon with drunks I don’t know. Bit of a late one was that – arriving back for 4. </p>

<p>After project meetings on Saturday to discuss our trip today with the other half of the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="PASOA">PASOA</a> project in Southampton, I didn’t have time to attend a bar-b I’d been invited too, and instead went straight over to Jon and Cathy’s for rather random games evening with lots of lego and frustrating “Guess Who” games. I was a tad upset to find that after nipping to the loo, all my passengers had defected to the dark side by going back with Jennie – the cheek! After confronting her on Sunday she also announced she’d stolen my aerial off my car! Gah!</p>

<p>All in all a fab weekend, though I don’t think I could keep it up every week.</p>

<p>Note to self 1: Games where I (or as a member of a team, ahem – Rob) lose, are rubbish, especially played against girls. That’s probably why I enjoy playing shoot-em-ups offline (or against Tim).</p>

<p>Note to self 2: Don’t go calling the children of your Church leaders names, not even in jest, it has a habit of getting back to them.</p>

<div class="author_meta">05 Apr 2005</div>
<p>There’s loads of places on the net where you can view silly or stupid signs. Most of the ones I’ve seen aren’t from the UK though, and I can’t imagine them any kind of scenario, which I think would make them all the more funny. This place has loads, so many I can’t afford to look through all of them. I can’t believe I’ve missed it before.</p>

<p>If I had something interesting to say I would say it, but I don’t really so instead I’ll hit you with a few ebay bargains I’ve picked up of late. Currently I’m holding a rating of 166 positive, I reckon thats pretty good. Anybody else bought anything interesting off the net lately?</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4713354993&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">Cut N Paste – Forget It</a> [12” Single] (£1.99). I’ve been after this ever since I heard it on a Fatboy Slim ‘On the Floor at the Boutique’ mix CD donkeys years ago….</li>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;category=64228&#038;item=7952327398">David Nicholls – Starter For Ten</a> [Book] (£0.01). I started this after getting annoyed with reading huge mundane chunks of history in 1984. Loads of this is so close to the truth its scary, I’ve carried stupidly heavy things across Cardiff for instance, more than once actually, just to save a quid or so. Its great, despite being a “Richard and Judy Bookclub Bestseller”.</li>
  <li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4707809284&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">LHB – Tell ‘Em Who We Are</a> [CD Album] (£0.99) This is an absolutely amazing album, can’t see how I’ve ever missed it before. Even more so as these guys were once big beat wonders back on good old Bolshi records.</li>
  <li>A <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=6157425220&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">4.5M x 0.75M ‘Scrumpy Jack’ banner</a> (£4.00). This is pure comedy value. Just need to find a way of hanging this on the wall…was provided with a few ropes…hmm..</li>

<div class="author_meta">28 Mar 2005</div>
<p>Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday. Me being a little bit more independant of late, thought sod it and went by myself, getting bought drinks by Phantom Beats (the guy I went to see) while I was there…nice.</p>

<p>I just returned from my actual birthday here at home, bowling…..exciting stuff! Ah well, once again not that many people about, with a distinct lack of things available to do in our small town in Somerset. The cream on the cake is I just discovered on returning, I share my birthday with a great comedian – namely <a href="http://frostitution.net/" title="Fanpage">Nick Frost</a>, star of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead fame. Rock on!</p>

<h1><a href="/2005/03/14/birthday-blues">Birthday Blues</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">14 Mar 2005</div>
<p>I’m trying to decide what to do for my birthday which falls on Bank holiday monday this year. Currently I’m of the mind to do something on Good Friday like have a meal, then off to town (Chico Fresco and Phantom Beats will be at bsb apparently)….Leaving me free to go back and have easter and my actual birthday with family and friends. I’m going to be 24…<em>24</em>,<strong>24?!</strong>, no surely thats not right! I still feel about 18 and all my years as an undergrad never happened, I certainly don’t <em>act</em> my age. Ah well, I’ll get over it..It’s not actually that big a deal. I’ll have to anyway, it’ll happen again next year. If anyones about in cardiff then and wants to help me celebrate, please let me know!</p>

<p>I had my first quote immortalised upon our quote board at home, I’m usually quite careful not to say anything stupid with housemates about, thats Tim’s job, but this was due to a recent trip to the bay. I was talking to Cath Evans about my last trip to the bay (on my 20th birthday co-incidentally), where upon we were set upon by a load of kids off of the estate who decided to throw rocks at us whilst waiting for the train. Anyway it reads <em>“This is my first trip to the bay since we got stoned on my birthday.”</em> I think a lot of people on the train got an unintended impression of me after that conversation.</p>

<div class="author_meta">10 Mar 2005</div>
<p>I was a right little Heathen yesterday and skived off of housegroup to meet up with Mr Bryer in Bristol to see the awesome <a href="http://www.lemonjelly.ky" title="Lemon Jelly">Lemon Jelly</a>. Whats even better was the fact that <a href="http://www.sonicflux.co.uk">Ben Lilford</a> had come along too, unbeknown to me before arriving. They are quite literally the most amusing band ever. Prior to the Jel’s entrance we were treated to Don Partridge (a one man band) whilst trying to play a couple of party games (find 3 stooges hidden in the audience).</p>

<p>I think the best moment of the evening was everyone was dancing to the vocal from “Nice Weather For Ducks” over some really heavy beats. It’s taken from an old nursery rhyme and goes <em>“All the ducks are swimming in the water, fah la la la rahldo, fah la la la rahldo”</em> or something like that, you can hear a more downtempo version <a href="http://www.cissme.com/bgroup-us/rm/xl/lemon/video/ifxls156dvd-01_rvh.ram">here</a>. It’s got to be the only place I’m ever gonna be dancing alongside a horde of drunken louts (one of which insisting at making <em>the</em> most annoying moose sound after every track), one very sweet and tiny little old lady and still feel content. </p>

<p>Ok, not to totally contradict my last post, I’ve just read a comedy web page all about me that was put up 5 years ago which I never knew existed! You might like to take a look <a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/presence/dj.htm">here</a>. It seems my music tastes haven’t changed all that much, as the songs I quote are all still top tunes…I may of gotten all technical for no reason.</p>
