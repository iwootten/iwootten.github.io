<h1><a href="/2006/11/03/techno-graveyard">Techno Graveyard</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 Nov 2006</div>
<p>Our front room is looking a bit of a technology graveyard at the moment. Not only do we have the two archaic computers which have been there since forever, but now we also sport an unused fridge which has been replaced by one of our housemates parents (much larger) hand-me-downs.</p>

<p>This time last year saw the cleaning out of the Cardiff Department of Computer Science’s cupboards, with a large amount of the machines having to be “properly disposed of”, due to their burden of having huge crt monitors from yesteryear. Presumeably this means they are taken to be properly disassembled and resused if possible – somewhere like <a href="http://www.wastechnique.com/">wastechnique</a> in wales for example. When it was suggested that they be offered to charities who would re-use the machines sent to third world countries and the like, the idea was rejected because the scheme had never been attempted before.</p>

<p>It’s quite crazy how disposable technology has become in modern life. I suppose I notice it more now due to having that much more of it myself, I have 3 past mobile phones in my possession currently, not counting those back in Yeovil. I wonder what little gadgets we’ll be chucking out 10, 20 years down the line…..</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/10/31/halloween">Halloween</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">31 Oct 2006</div>
<p>Does anyone else get the distinct impression that halloween is reserved for lamers? I mean, correct me if I’m wrong, it stems from a pagan festival celebrating a time at which spirits can make contact with the physical world. Is that something people really want to be celebrating? </p>

<p>I assume that the majority of the world goes along with the fact its just a bit of fun, a time at which kids get dressed up and collect sweets door-to-door, punishing those who don’t pay up with a bombing of baking compnents and parents play the niave fools. It’s a bit strange that people are so wound up with partying they don’t even know why they’re doing it. The same goes for Christmas and Easter too.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/10/16/bash-bash">Bash bash</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 Oct 2006</div>
<p>I was quite impressed with myself the other day that I’d actually managed to write a bash script within ubuntu which served a purpose. I wanted to be able to monitor the size of files within a particular directory, and report back their size when a change was observed.</p>

<p>I found a program called <a href="http://fileschanged.sourceforge.net">fileschanged</a>, which fulfilled half the problem, namely reporting back a file had changed, but I needed a greater level of detail than that. What it did allow me to do however was pass the filename as an argument (along with some other parameter) to another program. I duely spent an hour or so trying to figure out a script to take that filename and report back its filesize and the current time (which I assume is close enough to that which the file was changed). This is what it looks like: &lt;div class="wp_syntax"&gt;</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/10/13/ow-my-arse">Ow! My arse!</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">13 Oct 2006</div>
<p>For the 3rd time I can remember ever I came off my bike this morning. I took a corner too sharply and ended up sliding across the road. So I am currently sitting here with gravel ridden hands and a really sore arse. I thought to go and check my arse when I finally arrived at uni and decided that it might be an idea to find something to stop the injury oozing all over my underwear. Much to the amusement of the staff in reception who commented that they’d be able to help me apply first aid, but both of them would need to attend as they were of the opposite sex. I decided to go ahead and apply it myself. A wound dressing might be slightly overkill, but hopefully more comfortable when I return home.</p>

<p>It hurts.</p>

<div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2006</div>
<p>I’ve been following a number of so called “web 2.0″ companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It’s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I’d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there’s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I’ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I’d be very interested. I’m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck……</p>

<div class="author_meta">24 Sep 2006</div>
<p>I thought I’d pose this as a question because I’m unsure if this is indeed my final year. It’s quite strange to think at the end of this thing I’m actually going to have to find some work somewhere another. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated from whomever. I’m looking for £50k/yr involving part time work from home, company car, but then I think the rest of the world is too.</p>

<p>I go through the enrolment thing tomorrow, with whatever follows throughout the rest of the year on the cards too. You know, taking a few labs and tutorials, Christmas, New Years, some more labs and tutorials, my 26th birthday (sheesh!) getting wed……..I’ll stop there.</p>
