<div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2006</div>
<p>I’ve been following a number of so called “web 2.0″ companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It’s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I’d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there’s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I’ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I’d be very interested. I’m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck……</p>

<div class="author_meta">24 Sep 2006</div>
<p>I thought I’d pose this as a question because I’m unsure if this is indeed my final year. It’s quite strange to think at the end of this thing I’m actually going to have to find some work somewhere another. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated from whomever. I’m looking for £50k/yr involving part time work from home, company car, but then I think the rest of the world is too.</p>

<p>I go through the enrolment thing tomorrow, with whatever follows throughout the rest of the year on the cards too. You know, taking a few labs and tutorials, Christmas, New Years, some more labs and tutorials, my 26th birthday (sheesh!) getting wed……..I’ll stop there.</p>

<div class="author_meta">17 Sep 2006</div>
<p>I’m selling my car, which has been with me for the last 4/5 years and always been very reliable. It’s a very nice Vauxhall Corsa 1.5 TD in red, for more details, check freeads <a href="http://cars.uk.freeads.net/1994_L_reg_VAUXHALL_CORSA-229570.htm">here</a> and drop me an email either through freeads or this website if you’re interested.</p>

<p>I’m pretty sad to see the thing go, but as I now have no need for it due to the acquiring of my own personal chauffeur, it seems a bit uneconomical to hang on to it.</p>

<p>I’ve been suffering at the hands of the sheer size of the web recently. Just starting off at popurls yields many hours spent just browsing randomly across many, many web buzz sites. Although its all very interesting, its not particularly useful to my research, or in fact my own projects.</p>

<div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2006</div>
<p>I spent a large amount of time last week, after realising that I could very easy install compiz and XGL on my machine at uni, trying to install it upon my home machine. As its 64 bit, and owing to previous problems I’d experienced installing 64 bit applications (like linux for instance), I spent the best part of 2 days attempting to install both, before caving and completely giving up.I got to the stage where XGL is installed properly and seems to work ok, but the compiz gnome window manager isn’t working properly, meaning I have no borders to any panes I create.It’s not like I need a whizzy 4 sided cube spinning around, but I thought it might be fun…</p>

<p>Hi there, we’ve not spoken in a while. How’s you?It seems I’ve been succumbing to a lifestyle of late that I wish I would never end up at – that of working within a “routine”. I must be getting old. The whole of last week seemed a little bit of a drain, working my ass off trying to get tiny parts of code to work properly in the day and the rest of the time being tired that I was staying up late to give myself alone time in the evenings. The day and evening seem to blur to become a big mess when I’m working hard, I lose all concept of what should really be important to me and where my efforts should really be put.Anyway, I’ve been up to lots other than working, went off to greenbelt last week, which was unexpectedly cool (especially the Ukelele Orchestra!) and spent this weekend with very little time spare once it had all been used up with meeting people, socialising and whatnot. Oh deary me, whats going on? Do I finally have a life?</p>

<p>I’ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">code igniter</a> tonight, a php mvc framework. I discovered it yesterday, not realising that such things were available for php. As its extremely lightweight and seems to speeding up things no-end already, I reckon I’ll probably be using it on some of my new <a href="http://www.slimshot.org">slimshot</a> projects I’m planning on working on soon. I just need to get another life somewhere so I can actually go about implementing all this stuff.</p>

<div class="author_meta">19 Aug 2006</div>
<p>I’ve had a couple of problems getting my slug working nice under ubuntu. Firstly, although it is recognised by default and I can connect and browse via samba, when I actually came to playing my media, everything got screwed up, with Amarok trying to launch kmail…… I could copy files to ubuntu and play them properly from there, but straight off of the slug was a no go.I found the solution was to mount it under ubuntu using the command:<code>sudo mount -t smbfs //NAS/DISK 1 /media/slug -o username=user,password=pass</code>Where user and pass are your username and password for the slug respectively and the backslash indicates a space. This poses another problem however, that you don’t want to have to fire up a terminal everytime you want to listen to media, instead its better to get it automounted at startup using an entry in /etc/fstab:<code>sudo gedit /etc/fstab</code>and then add a line:<code>//NAS/DISK 401 /media/slug	smbfs	username=user,password=pass,rw&lt;br /&gt;
</code></p>

<p>Again supplimenting user and pass with your username and password. The  40 indicates a space in the name of the share which is on the NAS, which annoyingly took me a large amount of time to figure out!</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to create a site which attracts lot of attention for ages. Not to create some profit-making venture, just to know that my voice was being listened too elsewhere and hopefully appreciated. I suppose that goes for my PhD too. It’s kind of depressing however that almost everything ever has been done, and every avenue seems blocked in both respects. How do you contribute to a world that is uninsterested in what you have to say? Being a man of high moral standards (!) I don’t ditch them and say what I think people want to hear, I suffer at their hands silently instead.</p>
