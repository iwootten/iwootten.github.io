        Yesterday I got a little annoyed about the fact that it seemed as if play had forgotten all details of my existence and telling me my email address was wrong. After sending a little letter off to them complaining yesterday evening, I realised after their response that actually I’d altered my saved email a little while before. I went ahead and placed my order of Sideways this morning which I’d expected to be fairly good due to the rave reviews I’d heard of it.

        From “How To Succeed With Women Without Really Trying” c1957
“The first wife, as opposed to the fiancee, must be practicable and serviceable. She is neither a toy, an ornament, nor a playmate. She will be your wife during the early, hard years before you can afford a staff of servants. She will serve as mother, cook, housemaid, chauffeur, nurse, and charwoman. This will allow her, if she is nimble, six or seven hours of sleep a night, ample for a sturdy girl.

        So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).

        Woohoo, rock on – its almost holiday season for me. Next week I’ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh…Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I’ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who’ll be there with me – you best make it a good’n.

        Currently, I’ve been spending many an hour pondering domain name choices for a fair trade t-shirt site I’d like to set-up, but never actually committing to one, due to the rather lacklustre responses of others on hearing my suggestions, or not finding anything suitable which conveys what I am trying to get across (a hip, trendy t-shirt place, ala threadless.com).If anyone can think of anything clever – let me know.

        Interestingly, two of my most used sites hotmail and ebay, seem to be unavailable at the moment for me to peruse in my daily late night browsing routine. Maybe ntl is doing something stupid at the moment, in fact this is most likely the problem as large amounts of images around the web are unable to be displayed for one reason or another.

        So I managed to make it to the zoo yesterday, which was very exciting. More exciting though, was the night safari, where everything is minimally lit with the animals there to give a night time experience (I expect). I was a bit worried about catching buses and the like, but it was fine in the end, everything was really very well laid out, it was a doddle.
Today I’m off to visit the somewhat artificial Sentosa island – there seems to be a bit of controversy about the fact the land is all ‘reclaimed’.

        I’ve just returned from the conference dinner to finalise CCGRID for ’06. Tomorrow will be its last day whereupon everyone will return to their various different countries, or maybe somewhere closer for a short time on holiday. I’ve already heard of others plans to see Malaysia and Vietnam. I’ll be here until Tuesday evening to check out all that Singapore has to offer (at least I hope I will be able to).

        So, I have arrived safe and sound in Singapore. I got in yesterday and have been doing various CCGrid related things since. Yesterday evening, after a quick shower I headed off to find the conference venue and something to eat. Unfortunately I spent the best part of my time wondering round trying to find the venue! It was rather annoying as a large majority of pedestrian routes had been obstructed due to a huge amount of road works going on around the university premises.

        So despite having only been back in the UK for less than a week, I’m now off to Singapore, to present another paper of my work at CCGrid06. I’m slightly less nervewracked this time, but not looking forward to the ridiculous flight time (best part of 13 hours) and the time difference when I arrive (+ 7 hours). Viv tells me its a beautiful and amazingly techie place, so it sounds not at all distant from my own bedroom.
