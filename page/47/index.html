      <div class="author_meta">22 Apr 2005</div>

          <p>Having free time in the evenings recently is a wonderful thing, and its given me the chance to think about &#8216;stuff&#8217; I might not of done otherwise, recently its been my undergrad life. When I came to University, I was all fired up for an amazing walk through Christendom, I tried to throw myself into the Christian Union, and for a while it was great. Unfortunately my work got a grip of me very quickly, and for all the wrong reasons I backed off from CU and any kind of fellowship with others. I didn&#8217;t really settle at any Church well here and the year I spent at home made it even worse by becoming more disjointed from my Cardiff life&#8230;.</p>
<p>I got my degree, and a good one at that, but I can&#8217;t help but think I put myself through hell (this time last year was awful for me) for absolutely zero benefit over what could have been. I know I&#8217;ve been taken down this path for a reason and while I might think there wasn&#8217;t anything going on, the whole experience is a lesson in discipline in itself.</p>
<p>Changing churches and attending a housegroup this year has been great, I&#8217;ve made some fantastic friends and its pushed me forward in ways I wouldn&#8217;t of thought possible, building me (and I hope others) up with far more on the horizon. Anyway, suffice to say reflecting on this hasn&#8217;t been great for me this week, but I&#8217;ve also felt encouraged by a few words I&#8217;ve been given of late about my character&#8230;trying to be a little more confident and forthcoming about my feelings, due to my unique slant on the world.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been running around a bit like a headless chicken recently, not content with spending lots of time at uni working, I&#8217;ve been partying pretty hard as well. </p>
<p>Spent Friday going to Kez&#8217;s 21st birthday for a meal at Old Orleans, which was rather tasty. Bombed back to hang out with Vineyardites at Marty&#8217;z Kitchen, which we were duely moved on from to Cafe aroma, and back to mine (after a few choice insults were uttered by me) for a nice cuppa. After that, decided to go on to Sumo at the Welsh club with Aquasky and Masterblaster, once again having a fab time on my own and dancing about like a loon with drunks I don&#8217;t know. Bit of a late one was that &#8211; arriving back for 4. </p>
<p>After project meetings on Saturday to discuss our trip today with the other half of the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="PASOA">PASOA</a> project in Southampton, I didn&#8217;t have time to attend a bar-b I&#8217;d been invited too, and instead went straight over to Jon and Cathy&#8217;s for rather random games evening with lots of lego and frustrating &#8220;Guess Who&#8221; games. I was a tad upset to find that after nipping to the loo, all my passengers had defected to the dark side by going back with Jennie &#8211; the cheek! After confronting her on Sunday she also announced she&#8217;d stolen my aerial off my car! Gah!</p>
<p>All in all a fab weekend, though I don&#8217;t think I could keep it up every week.</p>
<p>Note to self 1: Games where I (or as a member of a team, ahem &#8211; Rob) lose, are rubbish, especially played against girls. That&#8217;s probably why I enjoy playing shoot-em-ups offline (or against Tim).</p>
<p>Note to self 2: Don&#8217;t go calling the children of your Church leaders names, not even in jest, it has a habit of getting back to them.</p>

          <p>If I had something interesting to say I would say it, but I don&#8217;t really so instead I&#8217;ll hit you with a few ebay bargains I&#8217;ve picked up of late. Currently I&#8217;m holding a rating of 166 positive, I reckon thats pretty good. Anybody else bought anything interesting off the net lately?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4713354993&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">Cut N Paste &#8211; Forget It</a> [12&quot; Single] (£1.99). I&#8217;ve been after this ever since I heard it on a Fatboy Slim &#8216;On the Floor at the Boutique&#8217; mix CD donkeys years ago&#8230;.</li>
<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;category=64228&#038;item=7952327398">David Nicholls &#8211; Starter For Ten</a> [Book] (£0.01). I started this after getting annoyed with reading huge mundane chunks of history in 1984. Loads of this is so close to the truth its scary, I&#8217;ve carried stupidly heavy things across Cardiff for instance, more than once actually, just to save a quid or so. Its great, despite being a &#8220;Richard and Judy Bookclub Bestseller&#8221;.</li>
<li><a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=4707809284&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">LHB &#8211; Tell &#8216;Em Who We Are</a> [CD Album] (£0.99) This is an absolutely amazing album, can&#8217;t see how I&#8217;ve ever missed it before. Even more so as these guys were once big beat wonders back on good old Bolshi records.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&#038;rd=1&#038;item=6157425220&#038;ssPageName=STRK:MEWN:IT">4.5M x 0.75M &#8216;Scrumpy Jack&#8217; banner</a> (£4.00). This is pure comedy value. Just need to find a way of hanging this on the wall&#8230;was provided with a few ropes&#8230;hmm..</li>

      <div class="author_meta">05 Apr 2005</div>

          <p>There&#8217;s loads of places on the net where you can view silly or stupid signs. Most of the ones I&#8217;ve seen aren&#8217;t from the UK though, and I can&#8217;t imagine them any kind of scenario, which I think would make them all the more funny. This place has loads, so many I can&#8217;t afford to look through all of them. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve missed it before.</p>

          <p>Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday. Me being a little bit more independant of late, thought sod it and went by myself, getting bought drinks by Phantom Beats (the guy I went to see) while I was there&#8230;nice.</p>
<p>I just returned from my actual birthday here at home, bowling&#8230;..exciting stuff! Ah well, once again not that many people about, with a distinct lack of things available to do in our small town in Somerset. The cream on the cake is I just discovered on returning, I share my birthday with a great comedian &#8211; namely <a href="http://frostitution.net/" title="Fanpage">Nick Frost</a>, star of Spaced and Shaun of the Dead fame. Rock on!</p>
