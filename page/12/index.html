<p>Digg.com is sporting the ability to be able to now rate online video and podcasts. Postcast searching is in limited beta for registered users only.I just spent a while perusing some items of interest, and found a great segment of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8169033819829939284&#038;hl=en">play</a>! over on google. This just builds on the fact that Mario has the most awesome music ever.The searching of podcasts is dangerously close to an idea I’ve currently working on myself for a while now. Maybe I should get on with it.</p>

<div class="author_meta">14 Dec 2006</div>
<p><a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch UK</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com">Techcrunch’s</a> european sister site has recently had a lot of activiity from <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/12/11/le-web3-the-good-bad-and-ugly/">some notes</a> which the editor at the time, Sam Sethi made about the recent <a href="http://leweb3.com">leweb3</a> event.This invited some comments from Six Apart’s Loic Le Meur in which he called Sam “an asshole”. Sam subsequently posted another blog about the fact that TechcrunchUK would be setting up its own events and workshops in the forthcoming year. It seems this displeased techcrunch’s Mike Arrington enough to give Sam the boot. The TechcrunchUK site has since been put on hold.I enjoyed TechcrunchUK’s insight into the UK world of web 2.0, I sorely hope this does not signal its end.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that long ago that I <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/10/13/ow-my-arse">posted about coming off of my bike</a> due to a slippery road, but this time was a bit different. Today somebody properly smacked me off of my bike! They were attempting to cut round a light-enabled junction when the lights had gone green in a different direction. As there is a small window of time only 1 or two generally make this turn, but this car decided that it should go even if it wasn’t its turn. They wheelspun out and clipped my backwheel, kicking my bike out from under me. I promptly leapt to my feet and gave them a whole host of verbal abuse in the middle of the road, before going to meet them where they pulled in. There I explained to them (throught the art of shouting) why attempting the turn was difficult (you are essentially doing a 180 degree turn) and ridiculous when it was the crossing traffic’s right of way. Their excuses were rather pathetic to say the least, and I told them that even if they ‘didn’t know the area’, that this should prompt some caution and mowing down cyclists wasn’t the way to go to make friends.</p>

<p>I can’t believe some people, this is the first time I’ve physically been struck by a vehicle and was a really stupid mistake.</p>

In their own words:<em>“If you are tired of seeing everyone else with the hottest friends and want some hotties of your own, then this is the place for you.”</em>For the princely sum of $1.99 – or $0.99 as an introductory offer, you can purchase a friend to leave you two comments on your profile per week. The photo’s seem to all rather fake, as their name would suggest.I would give you some more stats, but it seems that fakeyourspace is either suffering from the mashable effect (being mashed?), or indeed that its been pulled for being completely and utterly ridiculous. I wouldn’t be surprised if myspace or facebook had been on their backs in order to cut the kind of fake networking that such a system would introduce. They could easily kill each of the profiles which had been created on any of their networks if not.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/12/01/does-threadless-rule-or-not">Does Threadless rule or not?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">01 Dec 2006</div>
<p><a href="http://www.threadless.com/?streetteam=scrumpyjack"><img src="http://www.threadless.com/scrap/myspace/lovethreadless.gif" border="0" /></a>Last night I perused a number of articles describing the success of my favourite t-shirt store <a href="http://threadless.com">threadless</a>, the first of which – over at <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/68-7-reasons-why-threadless-rules">37Signals</a> reviews in a positive light and the <a href="http://www.hiphipuk.co.uk/2006/11/07/7-reasons-why-threadless-dont-rule-as-much-as-they-used-too/">second in a more negative one</a>.<a href="http://threadless.com">Threadless</a> is a t-shirt company with a difference, it’s a 24-7 competition allow you to become the designer. Designs are chosen by the team, and are able to be rated by the community that operates around the website.For anyone who knows me, they’ll know I love threadless tees – I believe I’m on my 4th one this week, and I have more in the post. I even got <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/256308445/">engaged in one of their t-shirts</a>, although it was possibly the most highly innappropriate one to do it in.<center>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imw/256308445/" title="Engaged"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/79/256308445_df791e697c.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="CIMG7458.JPG" /></a>
</center>I </p>

<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/255906494/">visited</a> <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/imw/255906648/">them</a> when as I was about in Chicago, though I think they probably thought I was a bit of an English loon. I find their designs original and amusing but it seems that those who kicked off the site are kicking back with some negative comments on what the sites community now represents. It shook me a bit that not everyone is as overly enthusiastic with them as I.<center>

</center>+’s:(from 37Signals) </p>

<p><strong>They’re playful</strong> – I have to say that this is one of the aspects I find most appealing, just the sheer comedy value to be found in not only their shirt designs, but the website (including many videos of daily threadless life), their emails, their attitude to the popularity. It’s great, it makes people feel good.<strong>It’s driven by community</strong> – This is what makes any web app successful but it seems threadless have been at it from day one and done a really good job at integrating it into their site. 37Signals points out the fact that participation is equal (though is visually far larger on their design), to the main consumer reason for visiting the site. When I was about to head out to Chicago, I contacted threadless as a customer to query the length of time it was taking to get an order out to me, and cheekily asked if they had any recommendations for places to visit while I was out there. Brianne, their customer service lass, replied with a huge description of what there was to do in the area, along with her personal favourites – its that kind of dedication to their community which builds them loyal customers.-’s:<strong>Bad Canvas, Second Rate Knock Offs</strong> – I don’t think their t-shirts are bad quality! Blimey, they’re only $10 half the time! Seriously, the printing quality claims and ‘feel’ of the shirts used are all a bit unfounded I think and more likely the result of teens who don’t know how to execute proper household management. The second aspect there however is going to be tackled when they soon start using their <a href="http://www.threadless.com/news/88235/EXCITING_NEWS_ABOUT_THE_TEES_WE_PRINT_ON">own specially designed material</a>. I read one example of a chap complaining of bad quality, who then went on to say he’d purchased a bunch more – surely they can’t be all that bad to warrant further purchases? As for second rate knock offs, I can’t say that I know the design community inside out, but I know I’ve never seen any of the designs anywhere else, and thats half the reason I love them.<strong>It’s myspace with t-shirts</strong> – Ah, yes, I feel your pain. Although I love what I can get out of threadless with a passion (i.e tees), I certainly despise myspace with a huge amount of disgust. I’ve previously blogged about the fact that <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/11/13/do-web-users-want-web-standards/">myspace</a> needs to sort out its web standards, I also have a certain distaste for the types of people who hang out in such virtual communities, with nothing better to do. If threadless is the t-shirt equivalent of myspace, they’ve got two aspects right (t-shirts, web standards), but then nothing can alter the types of people that hang out there, at least not this instant. I think these types are always going to be of a certain nature. I’m oblivious to these users, as I’m not actively contributing in this manner, I’m just the consumer, so what does that really matter to me? Of course it would be embarrasing to meet said teens in my university class wearing the same shirts, but I’m in the uk and I haven’t seen many people with threadless this side of the country. In fact, I’ve only ever seen them in Chicago (go figure!), and Singapore.Anyway, I still assert that I love threadless, despite other opinions and people will still be getting shirts as presents over christmas. I may however, try to attempt getting tees from other equally good shirt sites, for fear of wearing clothing resembling my students.For those of who appreciate them also, check out this image of how one of their employees, charlie will soon be working daily:<center>

</center>That’s just pure quality.</p>

<div class="author_meta">19 Nov 2006</div>
<p>I don’t really understand microsoft, over the last few days, their live network has been experiencing problems every time I’ve tried to logon to access my email. Who knows what my 8 emails contain which are hidden within live mail, I certainly don’t. You would think that more people would be in uproar about this – I mean what if these were payment requests, final demands or quick response business proposals? I could be loosing out on some serious money here.</p>

<p>Apparently, even they are unsure of the problem – it could be that “This site may be experiencing a problem” or “The site may not be a member of the Windows Live Network”. These seem quite vague, I mean obviously the sites experiencing a problem as everything would be fine and dandy if not and I’m pretty sure that Live mail is a member of their Live network too. Why don’t you try telling me something that I don’t already know?</p>

<div class="author_meta">14 Nov 2006</div>
<p>The amazing Zach Braff has made an appearance over at <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/657/Some_Choices_Are_Just_Out_of_Reach">threadless</a> to show off the t-shirt which was designed to promote his new film, “The Last Kiss”. Apparently according to the <a href="http://www.threadless.com/loves/thelastkiss">audio interview</a> he gave, he also was going to try to wear it on scrubs at some point, with a cheeky reference to the film. It’s also featuring as part of their current $10 sale in the run up to christmas. I myself have purchased 3 more to add to my collection. Although its nice, Zach’s design wasn’t one of them.<center>
