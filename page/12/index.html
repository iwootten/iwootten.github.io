<h1><a href="/2007/01/16/why-cant-every-day-be-a-holiday">Why can&#8217;t every day be a holiday?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 Jan 2007</div>
<p>I had a some great times away on holidays recently. The first was at New Year in Rhayader with the usual suspects getting absolutely soaked and vowing never to let anyone else plan a walk ever again. It was good to get outside away from these pesky machines.</p>

<center>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imw/344314802/" title="Viv Pretends She's Happy"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/149/344314802_3970e9270c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="new years 07 017" /></a>
</center>

<p>As if that wasn’t enough, I went away to France to the slightly more exciting Alps for a skiing holiday for a week too. This was with Viv’s medic mates and spouses and future spouses. We were enrolled into a french ski school for the entire week, going from being complete liabilities to competent skiers on the funny bits of wood. </p>

<p>Viv and I were both enrolled at a slightly faster pace originally, but after my frustration of being at the back of the class for an entire lesson, playing constant catch up, thorough humiliation and Viv’s tiredness (she says) we decided to drop down with the majority of the rest of our group to the complete beginners group. I’d rather go and enjoy the experience at a comfortable pace than annoy everyone by being angry. Anyway, its not like I’m not a beginner.</p>

<p>By the last day, we were comfortable with getting chair and button lifts here there and everywhere and getting down the majority of the mountain without any further coaching, albeit on the beginner runs. I have a single scratch and bruise from the whole week, which is much better than some of the casualities I saw being loaded onto the aeroplane in Chambery. At some points however, I was extemely glad I knew I had travel insurance for my time there, like a straight run heading to a lowered car park with no feasible means of being able to stop (it somehow happened though), or realising what I seemed to be heading at some speed over had turned into jumps.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the very exciting photos.</p>

<div class="author_meta">21 Dec 2006</div>
<p>Apparently, according to the free English dictionary there is a couple of definitions other than the traditional UK understanding of the word pantomime. For those international readers who don’t know, a pantomime is a pretty awful example of B-List celebrities acting ability in the UK in which involves them dressing up in bad costumes and acting out a fairy tale or story. In Cardiff, the big panto is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk – where Jack is played by <a href="http://www.newtheatrecardiff.co.uk/English/whatson_detail.asp?ID=187">John Barrowman</a> (or Captain Jack from Torchwood and Dr Who). The other definition is: ‘The telling of a story without words, by means of bodily movements, gestures, and facial expressions.’.Sam Sethi has been in the <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/12/14/sam-sethi-is-sacked-from-techcrunch-uk/">news</a> <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/12/14/sam-sethi-has-nowhere-to-blog/">recently</a> with articles reporting on his departure from TechcrunchUK. <a href="http://samsethi.glaxstar.com/?p=30">Sam has recently called</a> Mike Arrington’s <a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=327">interpretation of events</a> a bit of a pantomime, with a lot of “oh no it isn’t”, “oh yes it is” type comments going on. The whole scenario has rolled on for a while now and definitely does not conform to the second interpretation of a pantomime. My only wish was that the original intention for the Techcrunch sites, i.e to report on web start-ups, be it in Europe or elsewhere remained the primary concern for them, and I didn’t have to be subjected to the arguments that editors of such blogs may have with one another. Then again, I may be perpetuating the whole ordeal by writing this post….</p>

<p>Digg.com is sporting the ability to be able to now rate online video and podcasts. Postcast searching is in limited beta for registered users only.I just spent a while perusing some items of interest, and found a great segment of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8169033819829939284&#038;hl=en">play</a>! over on google. This just builds on the fact that Mario has the most awesome music ever.The searching of podcasts is dangerously close to an idea I’ve currently working on myself for a while now. Maybe I should get on with it.</p>

<div class="author_meta">14 Dec 2006</div>
<p><a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch UK</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com">Techcrunch’s</a> european sister site has recently had a lot of activiity from <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/12/11/le-web3-the-good-bad-and-ugly/">some notes</a> which the editor at the time, Sam Sethi made about the recent <a href="http://leweb3.com">leweb3</a> event.This invited some comments from Six Apart’s Loic Le Meur in which he called Sam “an asshole”. Sam subsequently posted another blog about the fact that TechcrunchUK would be setting up its own events and workshops in the forthcoming year. It seems this displeased techcrunch’s Mike Arrington enough to give Sam the boot. The TechcrunchUK site has since been put on hold.I enjoyed TechcrunchUK’s insight into the UK world of web 2.0, I sorely hope this does not signal its end.</p>

<p>It seems, according to <a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2006/12/13/six-apart-removes-sam-sethis-typepad-account/">Ben Metcalfe</a>, that Sam Sethi has had <a href="http://samsethi.typepad.com">his typepad account</a> disabled by Six Apart, rendering him unable to post any updates on his recent departure from TechcrunchUK. <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/">Loic Le Meur</a> (Executive Vice President of Six Apart and General Manager of Europe, Middle East and Africa) is currently giving no information about the whole scenario upon his own blog.UPDATE: Apparently Sam Sethi’s blog is up and running, though he has to yet confirm this and post his take on the whole scenario.</p>

<p>It wasn’t that long ago that I <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/10/13/ow-my-arse">posted about coming off of my bike</a> due to a slippery road, but this time was a bit different. Today somebody properly smacked me off of my bike! They were attempting to cut round a light-enabled junction when the lights had gone green in a different direction. As there is a small window of time only 1 or two generally make this turn, but this car decided that it should go even if it wasn’t its turn. They wheelspun out and clipped my backwheel, kicking my bike out from under me. I promptly leapt to my feet and gave them a whole host of verbal abuse in the middle of the road, before going to meet them where they pulled in. There I explained to them (throught the art of shouting) why attempting the turn was difficult (you are essentially doing a 180 degree turn) and ridiculous when it was the crossing traffic’s right of way. Their excuses were rather pathetic to say the least, and I told them that even if they ‘didn’t know the area’, that this should prompt some caution and mowing down cyclists wasn’t the way to go to make friends.</p>

<p>I can’t believe some people, this is the first time I’ve physically been struck by a vehicle and was a really stupid mistake.</p>

<p><a href="http://fakeyourspace.com"><img id="image36" src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/12/fakeyourspace.PNG" alt="fakeyourspace" /></a>I heard about <a href="http://www.fakeyourspace.com">fakeyourspace</a> via <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/11/30/fakeyourspace-launches-buy-sexy-myspace-friends/">mashable</a> today, which offers the ability to purchase your own social networking friends to leave messages and comments on communities such as myspace and facebook (the only two web pages I ever see to be open when supervising university labs). In their own words:<em>“If you are tired of seeing everyone else with the hottest friends and want some hotties of your own, then this is the place for you.”</em>For the princely sum of $1.99 – or $0.99 as an introductory offer, you can purchase a friend to leave you two comments on your profile per week. The photo’s seem to all rather fake, as their name would suggest.I would give you some more stats, but it seems that fakeyourspace is either suffering from the mashable effect (being mashed?), or indeed that its been pulled for being completely and utterly ridiculous. I wouldn’t be surprised if myspace or facebook had been on their backs in order to cut the kind of fake networking that such a system would introduce. They could easily kill each of the profiles which had been created on any of their networks if not.</p>
