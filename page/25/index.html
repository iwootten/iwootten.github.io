<div class="author_meta">07 Jan 2005</div>
<p>So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life…boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John’s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.</p>

<p>I had a wicked time over New Years with the Southampton/Cardiff posse in Beddgelert, climbing Snowdon and enduring other peoples (mostly Stephen’s) sleeping habits. New Years Eve was especially great due to the copius amounts of party items that were flung our way by the local’s landlord. Check out the images here:  </p>

    I&#8217;m playing my first gig tonight, over at BSB with the <a href="http://www.itsofftheshelf.com" title="Off The Shelf website">&#8220;Off The Shelf&#8221;</a> guys, so am especially nervous at the mo. Luckily, it&#8217;s billed as a birthday party for Waldron so hopefully there&#8217;ll be a bit of a different atmosphere than normal.

<p>Cardiff Vineyard have got to be the biggest bunch of bloggers I’ve ever met, in a non-derogitory sense. Makes a change to Yeovil Community Church. Browsing around their main site and links from it, I’ve found, hmm, lets see:</p>

<p>Thats crazy….! – We’ve got say 25 ppl max when I’ve gone along, so thats over a 5th turned blogging converts. There are more, but I’ve not actually met them, or if I have I’ve not remembered their names! Quite reassuring to know that systems such as the one I did for my dissertation are being used out there. I expect YCC has like 5 people blogging in some shape or form, yet the Church is maybe 10 – 20 times that size. Talk about cutting edge…..</p>

<p>I’ve got rid of the old phpautogallery that I had and dumped simple php gallery up instead. I’ve also converted shedloads of photos over so that peeps can see what I’ve been up to recently and not so recently. This includes most of the weddings I’ve attended over the last few years of very close friends, plus a few random ones for good measure.</p>

<div class="author_meta">09 Dec 2004</div>
<p>Can it be December already? What have I been doing? Wheres the last 3 months gone? I have to say I feel more Christmas-sy this year in Cardiff than I have ever been up here. </p>

<p>There seems to have been a bit of a build up so far.. Watching “Bad Santa” back in Nov (quite possibly the most amount of swearing I’ve ever seen in a film), going to Germany the other week with all the festive fun over there. Now a flurry of meals and events in Cardiff before shipping back to Somerset and seeing all me ol’ muckers back there…man the other 3 years spent here seem well depressing compared to this! Not that actually there’s really that much going on now..</p>

<p>I expect they’ll be a number of pics showing events up here at some point, be sure to keep tabs on the gallery.</p>

<p>Thought I’d have a moan about a few bits and bobs…same old, same old</p>

<p>I had a bit of an interesting experience today when my speedo decided to die halfway to Rhwibina. Could have been worse I guess, could of been on the motorway. Anyway, best get that sorted.</p>

<p>Uni seems to be going ok, the works piling up a bit though. It’s a bit of a nightmare to think about teaching and researching within the same day, takes me ages to adjust and concentrate for that matter. Had a meeting with the other half of the research team in Southampton, so that got me up to speed on a lot of things.</p>

<p>I need to get some djing on the cards, but I’m too whimpish to go ahead and do it. Fear of rejection see. I’m doing nothing in the evenings, which is pretty awful, especially when it gets through to Friday night. Nov 5th brought it home a bit. I’m glad theres loads of other PhD’s about, at least I get a few things done with them, never really had that sort of interaction outside of uni hours with other people on my course as an undergrad.</p>

<p>I’ve been to so many of my close mates wedding over the last couple of years… In fact I don’t actually think any of the old school crew are still single! Anyway in celebration of this, and Pauls recent marriage to Lisa, I’ve shoved up a gallery to show off some of the pics I have for them.</p>

<p>The gallery is located [here][1], and for the blog here’s Paul in his new found role:</p>

<h1><a href="/2004/08/16/update">Update</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 Aug 2004</div>
<p>Seeing as how I haven’t posted anything here properly for far too long, I thought I’d give an update on everything I’ve been doing since we last spoke..</p>

<p>Firstly, I got my degree, with the grades I wanted, although not perhaps in the subjects I expected to get them in, though I guess thats always the way. As a result of that, I’m going to be staying on at Cardiff for a PhD conducting research into the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="Provenance Aware Service Oriented Architecture">PASOA</a> project over the coming year. I don’t know if I’m fully aware of what this is going to entail either academically or in terms of life the universe and everything. However I figure its best to attack this at this stage of my life when I’ve got no ties, rather than forever regretting it..</p>

<p>When asking for references for my PhD, I sent off a letter to my old place of work <a href="http://www.aeroint.com" title="My old employer">Aerosystems Intenational</a>, where I carried out a placement year upon the support team. On completing my exams and preparing to head off home for a visit to the parents, I recieved a call asking if I’d like to return for the summer.. I accepted, started the following week and hence have been tied up with that for the last 2 months! It’s been really strange being back there, after being away and all, the teams grown a bit and is constantly pulling in contractors to help out. I enjoyed my time back there however, they’re all very friendly.</p>

<p>I’ve discovered a sweet little button in w.bloggar which pulls in my current track from winamp – very cool &lt;div class="media"&gt;

<p>Blimey, some cheeky blighter signed up and posted on my blog! Well, I suppose it was my fault really seeing as how wordpress was configured to allow it! Anyway, I removed the offending post and reconfigured so we’re now back to normality…</p>

<p>In order to give a little more items of interest here, these are a few of the images which I’ve been creating to assist me with my Image Processing module here at Cardiff…</p>

<p>Basically, an image of a Chicken Breast is taken, and the best approximation to a cardioid found and displayed. This involves taking an image, performing Median filtering upon it to remove noise, edge detecting it with sobel masks, forming an accumulator space from the approximate gradient determined, and finally locating the largest peak within this space….</p>

<p>Boring eh? Take a look at a few of the images to see how it works…..I’ve impressed myself.</p>
