        There&#8217;s loads of places on the net where you can view silly or stupid signs. Most of the ones I&#8217;ve seen aren&#8217;t from the UK though, and I can&#8217;t imagine them any kind of scenario, which I think would make them all the more funny. This place has loads, so many I can&#8217;t afford to look through all of them. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve missed it before.

        Well, thats another year over and done with, on to the next. Unfortunately, due to the distinct lack of friends available at Cardiff or at home, it kinda all just happened, and is almost over. I went out for an romantic italian with Tim and Mark on Friday, featuring a couple of very grumpy waitresses. I had hopes to move on later on to bsb with people, but Tim was knackered from returning from a week of training and Mark wanted to save his efforts for the Easter Service on Sunday.

        I&#8217;m trying to decide what to do for my birthday which falls on Bank holiday monday this year. Currently I&#8217;m of the mind to do something on Good Friday like have a meal, then off to town (Chico Fresco and Phantom Beats will be at bsb apparently)&#8230;.Leaving me free to go back and have easter and my actual birthday with family and friends. I&#8217;m going to be 24&#8230;24,24?!, no surely thats not right!

        I was a right little Heathen yesterday and skived off of housegroup to meet up with Mr Bryer in Bristol to see the awesome Lemon Jelly. Whats even better was the fact that Ben Lilford had come along too, unbeknown to me before arriving. They are quite literally the most amusing band ever. Prior to the Jel&#8217;s entrance we were treated to Don Partridge (a one man band) whilst trying to play a couple of party games (find 3 stooges hidden in the audience).

        Ok, not to totally contradict my last post, I&#8217;ve just read a comedy web page all about me that was put up 5 years ago which I never knew existed! You might like to take a look here. It seems my music tastes haven&#8217;t changed all that much, as the songs I quote are all still top tunes&#8230;I may of gotten all technical for no reason.

        I&#8217;m finding quite a lot at the moment that my music stirs up far more emotion in me than ever before. I don&#8217;t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is &#8220;all about the music&#8221;. Tim&#8217;s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that?

        My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It&#8217;s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.
This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis&#8217;s in Swansea for a bit to say hi.

        I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic&#8230;! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I&#8217;d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!
