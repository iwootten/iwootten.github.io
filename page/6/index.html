      <div class="author_meta">20 Nov 2012</div>

          <p>Given there&#8217;s a bit of lovefilm bashing <a href="http://www.tomalloyd.com/lovefilm-hate-email/">going on in Wales</a> at the moment, I thought I&#8217;d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm. </p>
<p>Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I&#8217;ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/emailpublic/cmsnewsletter/uk-newsletter/LOVEFiLM-Newsletter/2012/Newsletter-Issue-No-409?cid=lfnl409tlweb&#038;brand=lovefilm"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Read-Newsletter-Issue-409-5.jpg" alt="" title="Read Newsletter Issue 409 5" width="470" height="906" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-569" /></a></p>
<p>I really couldn&#8217;t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema&#8217;s to perform reviews and certainly don&#8217;t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image. </p>
<p>Also, the first thing I&#8217;m drawn to is the image. Why lead me away from the title of that movie and make work to find the text for the heading? Don&#8217;t make the title and preview exactly the same size, or divide them up!</p>
<p>End of rant.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2012/09/04/recovering-images-from-sd-cards-with-photorec">Recovering Images from SD Cards with PhotoRec</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">04 Sep 2012</div>

          <p>I had the horrible situation last Sunday following removing a number of pictures using an SD reader from my SD card that when I inserted it in my camera, it registered nothing upon it. My heart sunk, because this card is stuffed full of images of me and my family (along with my 1 year old son growing up) and I was unsure of which ones I&#8217;d actually backed up. After perusing the hidden files on the card, all I could discover was the files I&#8217;d most recently transferred from the card&#8230;.great&#8230;</p>
<p>Partly this was my own fault &#8211; I&#8217;d already experienced problems with the reader in question when trying to write images for my <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> and shouldn&#8217;t have used it for transferring images I care about. The card in question is a uber cheapo <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Integral-USB-Single-Slot-Reader/dp/B000VY80AM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1346533453&#038;sr=8-1">Integral USB 2.0</a>. Despite what the amazon reviews say, steer well clear of it &#8211; this has been a pain from day one, with intermittent transfer problems which triggered this situation.</p>
<p>After a little more digging, I came across <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">Photorec</a>, a commandline utility which seemed like it would hopefully help recover some of the images. I attempted to use it with my card reader, but given it&#8217;s credentials I&#8217;ve given above, found the scanning process would cut out and couldn&#8217;t get through the whole card. At this point the card was being reported empty&#8230;.great&#8230;Given the way PhotoRec works, I understood it would still be possible to extract the images despite this. I decided to order another reader and hold fire until it had arrived &#8211; this time I opted for a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingston-Technology-Multi-Card-Reader/dp/B007PFQ0PC/">Kingston USB 3.0</a> (which I haven&#8217;t had any such problems with so far).</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>Here are the steps I followed after receiving my new sd reader to recover images from the card using PhotoRec. I&#8217;m listing them for anyone else who may have the same horrendous stomach wrenching problem I did last Sunday. It seems to have worked pretty well, with only 1 movie file coming out corrupted and about 500 images recovered.</p>
<p>Firstly, I wanted to take a copy of the card as it currently stood following my investigation. For this I used df, diskutil and ddrescue.</p>
<p>To determine where the card is currently mounted (look for the one that&#8217;s about the right size):</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>df -h</code></pre></div><p>To unmount the card so we can fiddle with it:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1</code></pre></div><p>To backup the card to a disk image on your macbook:</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>sudo ddrescue /dev/disk1s1 ./sdbackup/image.img backuplog</code></pre></div><p>Finally, using PhotoRec scan the disk image that was just created. My image was FAT formatted I scanned the whole thing rather than just unallocated blocks.</p>
<div class='hljs'><pre><code class='bash'>sudo ./photorec ~/sdbackup/image.img</code></pre></div><p>The final piece of this saga was to rename all the files PhotoRec created so they were in folders according to their exif data. My photos are all in folders like &#8220;2012_06_30&#8243;, so to have 500 files named &#8220;f0677440.jpg&#8221;, &#8220;f0688768.jpg&#8221; in a random PhotoRec directory would be pretty annoying. I had looked at setting up an automator task for this, but I ended up using <a href="http://www.petrosit.de/index.php/apps/12-pexiftool">PexifTool</a> for simplicities sake (I&#8217;m sure there are other alternatives). I believe if you go the Automator route, you may well have to install plugins in order to be able to extract exif data from files.</p>

          <p>This is a talk I did back in May at <a href="http://unifieddiff.co.uk">unifieddiff</a> about my time working as a web developer at Aardman Features. I talk quite a bit about the production process and what we take from staff in order to help them do their jobs properly. I quite enjoyed giving this talk &#8211; more so than those I&#8217;ve given in an academic capacity in the past.</p>

          <p>What are you doing? Why would you go down that road? Shouldn’t you be building something else? How long have you been doing this?</p>
<p>Sure you can fool your clients into thinking you’re adding value to their product. I know the truth. But how did you &#8211; with all your expertise get to the point in thinking that’s what you’re really doing?</p>
<p>This is your first project? Shouldn’t you be focusing on your clients problems? </p>
<p>Why are you busily building a framework, when you’re already overdue? You know there’s any flavour of ORM available already right? What’s wrong with you? Where are your requirements?</p>
<p>Do you think that you’re going to be able to produce something better than the thousands of contributors to that open source project you’re avoiding using? They’ve been doing it for years already, for thousands of use cases. You think somehow yours falls outside it’s catchment area? Seriously? How arrogant are you?</p>
<p>You’ve been blinkered into thinking you’re an expert in areas you&#8217;re not. When your time is spent solving the wrong problems and you’re not invited back, I hope you’ll realise that you’re nowhere near as good a hacker as you think.</p>
