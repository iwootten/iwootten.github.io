          <h1><a href="/2005/05/11/academia">Academia</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">11 May 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve had the fairly bizarre experience this week of attending the <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/ccgrid2005/" title="CCGrid 2005 Website">CCGrid 05</a> conference at city hall. This is my first conference and by all means a first introduction to my peers outside of the group involved with the <a href="http://www.pasoa.org" title="PASOA">PASOA</a> project I am working upon. I think the most interesting thing is how normal each of them actually are &#8211; I was expecting them all to have some sort of superiority complex for some reason. One thing I&#8217;ve learnt in academia thus far is that the further you move up the rungs of its ladder, the more respect you obtain and the more at ease I feel talking to people about, well, anything &#8211; most of the topics which come up are rarely to do with your work (or maybe I lead the conversation this way).</p>
<p>I always seem to get stressed about events like this in my academic calendar and the fact that I was busy Sunday with Church, lunch, afters, helping people move and then having to go into Uni late to collect stuff in prep for the 6:30 start on Monday means I must of got all of 4 hours sleep. I had so much stuff doing my head in it was stupid and had to resort to sleeping on my back (an extremely rare occurence, I usually wake in this state), which achieved nothing. This became a bit obvious on monday when asked the content of the 1 hour&#8217;s worth talks I&#8217;d just attended in the afternoon &#8211; for which I wasn&#8217;t able to give an answer.</p>
<p>In the evening, I had the exciting experience of attending my first fashion show (not actually mine, a fair trade one attended by me, organised by the Matthias&#8217;s) which for some reason made me think about hollyoaks and neighbours, who always used to be having them when I was back home. It was great, aside from the fact I was so tired by now I almost fell asleep in the dark and Rob and I looked like prats in front of an audience trying to find the edge of steps we needed to descend because we&#8217;d got there a little late. Housegroup this evening was on a similar tip, I struggled from falling over a couple of times whilst in &#8216;worship&#8217;. I&#8217;d best go to bed.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2005/05/07/matthias-week">Matthias Week</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">07 May 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve had a really great week this week, mainly due to spending a large majority of it with the wonderful Matthias&#8217;s and crew. I&#8217;m not sure if this was altogether intentional, but it was great however it happened. I enjoy the crazy banter, furious sarcasm and witty jokes which are often made at others expense&#8230;.</p>
<p>Monday we spent the day at Jon and Cathy&#8217;s eating and playing board games due to the unfortunate weather that occurred outside. Later featured some full-on frisbee action from the lads (well me), and all the girls flailing about like wallys in the park, followed by everyone trying to break the childrens playground there. Wraps back at Katies was a great way to end a fab day.</p>
<p>Wednesday we went over the Matthias&#8217;s again to have fud and watch a film I&#8217;ve been quoting for ever, &#8220;Happy Gilmore&#8221;, which should be featured in any self respecting Adam Sandler fan&#8217;s collection. I think it may have been understood and amused all who attended, which is always good.</p>
<p>Thursday was a Matthias free night (I had to try to keep back the tears) to prepare for the Friday night shennanigans of board games and food once again. I think it might be a while before &#8216;Rat Race&#8217; makes an appearance on my favourite games list and as I have been given numerous nicks for the impending doom I release with a dice roll on anyones behalf, I believe the same may be said by most others too. It brought back those competitive streaks in me once again and turned me into an apathetic evil grumpy guts, instead of my usual jolly self (?!). Also, its probably the last time we&#8217;ll dare a Morgan to eat something..</p>
<p>Today I spent the whole day farting about building a simple rss gathering script &#8211; basically compiling all the Cardiff Vineyard blogs into one page. I get fed up having to trawl all through the same websites everyday, so I&#8217;ve taken to use RSS/ATOM aggregators to do the job for me. Bit depressing that I chose this over sitting in the park in the sun though. Anyway, said script can be found <a href="http://users.cs.cf.ac.uk/I.M.Wootten/vineyard" title="Vineyard Newspaper">here</a>, beware its very slow (but fun), if I&#8217;ve missed someones blog, please let me know. I know about the various problems like: </p>
<ul>
<li><strike>A) Viv&#8217;s feed is busted</strike></li>
<li>B) The same photo&#8217;s show every time</li>
<li>C) It&#8217;s not true XHTML</li>
</ul>
<p>but to that I say &#8220;Gimme a break, would ya? You do better!&#8221;.</p>
<p>My blog&#8217;s found its way onto a few new websites too, the process of domination is making some headway. Ooh, and I also now have the ability to comment on photo&#8217;s, if you should so wish. There&#8217;s some wonderful specimens in the gallery, prime for mocking, so please do.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">30 Apr 2005</div>

          <p>I went off to meet up with my Sis and Viv in Swansea on Thursday night, the drive out there and around the bay was fantastic, beautiful scenery in wonderful weather that I don&#8217;t often get to see around Cardiff. I think the comparison was made between the bay and Roath Park by Viv, but to be honest, there isn&#8217;t much of one. After a full on carvery meal and everyone feeling like veritable fat jabba&#8217;s, we drove over to the mumbles to munch on ice-cream (follow the logic there). I unfortunately had a bit of an accident involving a bit of toffee however, which meant I had to make the trip back to Somerset yesterday in order the remedy the situation with the help of my dentist. </p>
<p>My parents were just about to leave for the bank holiday weekend when I finally managed to visit them and they requested my help to shift their caravan. This proved to be a bit more taxing than it sounds, due to the large bog that had now formed in the general vicinity of where the caravan is stored. After a lot of wheel-spins, a domestic between my parents (a trip to Yeovil wouldn&#8217;t be a trip to Yeovil without) and a swift handbrake application on the caravan by me, they were on their way.</p>
<p>I had hoped to make the Bass Invaders show at the union last night, due to it featuring the mighty Q-Bert, for whom it was the last night of his UK tour. It probably would of been amazing, but tickets were not going to be about and I was far too tired.</p>
<p>One good thing did come of the trip though, I finally managed to get some new vinyl boxes which my dad had made up for me. This now means I have a three-tier system for holding my records and my room has a scent of fresh cut mdf. It also means I need to be about 2 ft taller to have easy access to my decks. Oh well&#8230;  </p>

      <div class="author_meta">27 Apr 2005</div>

          <p>Every time I visit UGC Cardiff it brings back terrible memories of when I went to see &#8216;Matrix Revolutions&#8217; last year. A bit psyched by the fact that it may of be able to redeem the tragedy which was &#8216;Matrix Reloaded&#8217;, I went to see it with some of the Glamorgan crew on its day of release. All was going as well as could be expected, until when 3/4 way through we were treated to a bit of a fight sequence and aerial acrobatics, which didn&#8217;t really seem to fit with what we had been watching, but could of been some sort of trendy &#8216;dream sequence&#8217;. It became a bit clearer after 30 seconds or so of this show that this really didn&#8217;t make any sense and in fact when people started breaking through walls, talking backwards and walking upside down it was downright obvious what had happened. However, we were subjected to a further 1-2 mins of it before anyone bothered to sort it out, which took 20 or so minutes. Obviously we already knew what was going to happen when the scene was finally shown &#8211; we knew it back to front (ho ho). It&#8217;s just as well the film was rubbish or else I would of been really annoyed.</p>
<p>This evening however was a good experience at UGC, there&#8217;s a first. I went along to an advance screening of &#8216;The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy&#8217; with Jon, Cathy and Katie. Keeping true to the original radio show, book and tv show&#8217;s got to be a hard job by any stretch of the imagination, but I think it was pulled off rather well. I like the way that we expanded on what we knew of the Vogon&#8217;s (&#8220;You&#8217;re supposed to Stop!&#8221;) and revealing Deep Thought was a bit of a couch potato, this always appeals. Marvin was also fantastic &#8211; though I disagree with the fact that some people seem to think he was under-used, anything more would of been too much. Admittedly it did feel a bit crammed and I agree that if you hadn&#8217;t read, heard or seen any of Adams&#8217; stuff before you would probably be fairly lost. I wish in fact I hadn&#8217;t read the book so recently, it spoilt so much of the film as a lot of the script was word for word from it.</p>
<p>After this I went off for a housegroup social in the Crwys&#8217;s skittle alley..which was ever so slightly disappointing. I spent five minutes in the pub trying to find it (which involved pretending I needed the loo), as it was absolutely rammed to the brim. I guess I need to play it with mates back home who enjoy the more vicious version whereby throwing balls is permitted when skittles are being arranged or the balls are still being placed in the other end of the run. Much more exciting&#8230;.</p>
