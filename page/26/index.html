        So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life&#8230;boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John&#8217;s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.

        Cardiff Vineyard have got to be the biggest bunch of bloggers I&#8217;ve ever met, in a non-derogitory sense. Makes a change to Yeovil Community Church. Browsing around their main site and links from it, I&#8217;ve found, hmm, lets see:
Cardiff Vineyard
Jon Matthias
Helen Carslaw
Lewis Parfitt
Neil Morgan
Zo&euml; Morgan
Sarah-Louise
Thats crazy&#8230;.! &#8211; We&#8217;ve got say 25 ppl max when I&#8217;ve gone along, so thats over a 5th turned blogging converts.

        I&#8217;ve got rid of the old phpautogallery that I had and dumped simple php gallery up instead. I&#8217;ve also converted shedloads of photos over so that peeps can see what I&#8217;ve been up to recently and not so recently. This includes most of the weddings I&#8217;ve attended over the last few years of very close friends, plus a few random ones for good measure.

        Can it be December already? What have I been doing? Wheres the last 3 months gone? I have to say I feel more Christmas-sy this year in Cardiff than I have ever been up here.
There seems to have been a bit of a build up so far.. Watching &#8220;Bad Santa&#8221; back in Nov (quite possibly the most amount of swearing I&#8217;ve ever seen in a film), going to Germany the other week with all the festive fun over there.

        Thought I&#8217;d have a moan about a few bits and bobs&#8230;same old, same old
I had a bit of an interesting experience today when my speedo decided to die halfway to Rhwibina. Could have been worse I guess, could of been on the motorway. Anyway, best get that sorted.
Uni seems to be going ok, the works piling up a bit though. It&#8217;s a bit of a nightmare to think about teaching and researching within the same day, takes me ages to adjust and concentrate for that matter.

        I&#8217;ve been to so many of my close mates wedding over the last couple of years&#8230; In fact I don&#8217;t actually think any of the old school crew are still single! Anyway in celebration of this, and Pauls recent marriage to Lisa, I&#8217;ve shoved up a gallery to show off some of the pics I have for them.
The gallery is located here, and for the blog here&#8217;s Paul in his new found role:

        Seeing as how I haven&#8217;t posted anything here properly for far too long, I thought I&#8217;d give an update on everything I&#8217;ve been doing since we last spoke..
Firstly, I got my degree, with the grades I wanted, although not perhaps in the subjects I expected to get them in, though I guess thats always the way. As a result of that, I&#8217;m going to be staying on at Cardiff for a PhD conducting research into the PASOA project over the coming year.

        Blimey, some cheeky blighter signed up and posted on my blog! Well, I suppose it was my fault really seeing as how wordpress was configured to allow it! Anyway, I removed the offending post and reconfigured so we&#8217;re now back to normality&#8230;

        In order to give a little more items of interest here, these are a few of the images which I&#8217;ve been creating to assist me with my Image Processing module here at Cardiff&#8230;
Basically, an image of a Chicken Breast is taken, and the best approximation to a cardioid found and displayed. This involves taking an image, performing Median filtering upon it to remove noise, edge detecting it with sobel masks, forming an accumulator space from the approximate gradient determined, and finally locating the largest peak within this space&#8230;.

        Hmm, haven&#8217;t really written much here in a while. Things are going ok, I have my final 4 exams over the next fortnight which I&#8217;m currently struggling revising for. Will hopefully pull out the grades I want, but I&#8217;m cutting it fine..
I&#8217;ve also finished my project, and its up and running on the web at www.understroke.com (requires client side XSL processing, IE 6+ Mozilla 1.4+).
Anyway, thats all I have to say for now, I&#8217;m off to watch Kill Bill 2.
