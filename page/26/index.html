        I&#8217;m finding quite a lot at the moment that my music stirs up far more emotion in me than ever before. I don&#8217;t overly listen to sad songs, but I tend to find myself welling up at the most random of tracks. Quantic, Amon Tobin anyone? Pretty much most of these are without lyrics either, so I guess it really is &#8220;all about the music&#8221;. Tim&#8217;s once told me that there is no reason for us to really gain pleasure in listening to music, its just a bunch of random soundwaves, how can we possibly gain pleasure through that?

        My weekends are getting more and more full of stuff being a PhD student. It&#8217;s nice being able to confine my work to a 9-5 regime (or thereabouts) and do whatever I want outside of that, plus unlike being an undergrad, I get some money.
This weeks been pretty packed, after the fan dabby dosy weekend at Port Eynon with Cardiff Vineyard last week, I stopped by my sis&#8217;s in Swansea for a bit to say hi.

        I went to the Tsunami Relief concert held here in Cardiff on Saturday. I have to say, it was absolutely fantastic&#8230;! Made all the more special by the fact it was my first time in the stadium. Completely crazy to think I was in there for a good 7 hours or the hours I&#8217;d work in a day. I think probably best acts include Keane, Feeder (becuase I knew the words!

        So, the holiday season is all over and now I suffer the mundane reality that is my own life&#8230;boo hoo. Christmas was a little pants to be honest, as my Mum was in hospital the whole time I was at home, although it did make the place a lot quieter! Christmas Day was quite special as well, the fact that it snowed and all. It just so happened that this was when St John&#8217;s Church doors were opened after the morning service too, so everyone there was quite exciteable.

        Cardiff Vineyard have got to be the biggest bunch of bloggers I&#8217;ve ever met, in a non-derogitory sense. Makes a change to Yeovil Community Church. Browsing around their main site and links from it, I&#8217;ve found, hmm, lets see:
Cardiff Vineyard
Jon Matthias
Helen Carslaw
Lewis Parfitt
Neil Morgan
Zo&euml; Morgan
Sarah-Louise
Thats crazy&#8230;.! &#8211; We&#8217;ve got say 25 ppl max when I&#8217;ve gone along, so thats over a 5th turned blogging converts.

        I&#8217;ve got rid of the old phpautogallery that I had and dumped simple php gallery up instead. I&#8217;ve also converted shedloads of photos over so that peeps can see what I&#8217;ve been up to recently and not so recently. This includes most of the weddings I&#8217;ve attended over the last few years of very close friends, plus a few random ones for good measure.

        Can it be December already? What have I been doing? Wheres the last 3 months gone? I have to say I feel more Christmas-sy this year in Cardiff than I have ever been up here.
There seems to have been a bit of a build up so far.. Watching &#8220;Bad Santa&#8221; back in Nov (quite possibly the most amount of swearing I&#8217;ve ever seen in a film), going to Germany the other week with all the festive fun over there.

        Thought I&#8217;d have a moan about a few bits and bobs&#8230;same old, same old
I had a bit of an interesting experience today when my speedo decided to die halfway to Rhwibina. Could have been worse I guess, could of been on the motorway. Anyway, best get that sorted.
Uni seems to be going ok, the works piling up a bit though. It&#8217;s a bit of a nightmare to think about teaching and researching within the same day, takes me ages to adjust and concentrate for that matter.
