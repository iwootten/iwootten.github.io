<p>Blimey, some cheeky blighter signed up and posted on my blog! Well, I suppose it was my fault really seeing as how wordpress was configured to allow it! Anyway, I removed the offending post and reconfigured so we’re now back to normality…</p>

<p>In order to give a little more items of interest here, these are a few of the images which I’ve been creating to assist me with my Image Processing module here at Cardiff…</p>

<p>Basically, an image of a Chicken Breast is taken, and the best approximation to a cardioid found and displayed. This involves taking an image, performing Median filtering upon it to remove noise, edge detecting it with sobel masks, forming an accumulator space from the approximate gradient determined, and finally locating the largest peak within this space….</p>

<p>Boring eh? Take a look at a few of the images to see how it works…..I’ve impressed myself.</p>

<p>Hmm, haven’t really written much here in a while. Things are going ok, I have my final 4 exams over the next fortnight which I’m currently struggling revising for. Will hopefully pull out the grades I want, but I’m cutting it fine..</p>

<p>I’ve also finished my project, and its up and running on the web at <a href="http://www.understroke.com" title="My final year project">www.understroke.com</a> (requires client side XSL processing, IE 6+ Mozilla 1.4+).</p>

<p>Anyway, thats all I have to say for now, I’m off to watch Kill Bill 2..</p>

<p>Ahh, theres a result.</p>

<p>I’ve been working some image processing coursework trying to correctly label an B+W image with a different label for each object in the image…it’s taken ages!….</p>

<p>The basic premise is, go through each pixel in the image. If this pixel has a neighbour which is labelled, label it with that label, if two pixel neighbours labels differ, store the equivalence in a table and resolve it later. </p>

<p>Resolve the equivalence table (find the lowest equivalent neighbour and remember it). Do another pass to check if we still have equivalent items in the image. I’ve been struggling forever trying to find a way to resolve the equivalence table right down to the lowest level straight away in one pass, which is extremely difficult, so you perform multiple passes!</p>

<p>Anyway, glad that bits over – now onto the complex stats of it all!</p>

<p>I’m realling struggling at the moment to get a visual interface all sorted and loverly so people can literally “point-and-click”. I made the decision to do this after talks with both my supervisor and moderator and have been trying like crazy to get it sorted, its taken over a week so far! Not good.</p>

<p>My moderator also suggested that trying to find example XML schemas for CMS’s which were already out on the market at the moment for would make for good reading also.</p>

<p>I have to go see my supervisor this week anyway, will post to say how it went.</p>

<div class="author_meta">16 Feb 2004</div>
<p>Just had my mid-year meeting follow-up with my moderator. It seems he would like to see a focus on XML standards for this system, rather than just a botch of XML which I decided on. Don’t really know how I decide on that.</p>

<p>On searching for them though I found a CMS XML framework (uh-oh) which basically just outputs everything as XML. Find it <a href="http://www.bitflux.ch/developer/cms/popoon.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Just realised that my cms doesn’t display properly in IE6. Might explain why it looked so dodgy at my mid-year meeting with my supervisor.</p>

<p>Got a few extra things in my project, permission system is fully functional, priorities for roles, workflow management – all of which still have bugs. Going to get down to the actual “management” part of the CMS tomorrow.</p>

<p>What a waste of a day that was…I hate programming. </p>

<p>I’ve spent most of the day stuck on trivial little tasks like trying to pass back multi-dimensional arrays through scripts, and interpret the results.</p>

<p>On an upside, I’ve managed to get XSL producing XHTML output and generated a working grid for the actions in the system. I also found a bug in XSL which means that it will condense textarea tags to their smallest form, and resulting in incorrect display in most web browsers.</p>

<div class="author_meta">30 Jan 2004</div>
<p>After spending most of the day working upon it, I have managed to convert the whole template system in my project over to XML. I also added the beginnings of a permissions system which has no functionality yet. </p>

<p>This does need some time for me to go through the motions of Spec, Design, Implementation write-up for this over the weekend so that I can present it next week during my mid-year progress presentation with my project supervisor.</p>

<h1><a href="/2004/01/28/xml-xslt">XML, XSLT</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">28 Jan 2004</div>
<p>I’ve spent a large portion of today converting bits of my project over to using XML with XSLT stylesheets. This solves a few issues that I’d had problems with.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Generating RSS feeds.  </li>
  <li>The masses of files for each template is now reduced to a single XSLT file, easily modified by anyone knowing what they are doing.  </li>
  <li>Better compliance with web standards (missing “‘s, closing tags all need to be corrected) means that it should be relatively XHTML compliant when tested.  </li>
  <li>Well layed out source.</li>
</ol>

<p>I haven’t completely finished moving over to this new format but will try and sort it all by the end of tommorow.</p>
