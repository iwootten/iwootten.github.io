        Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my &#8220;business&#8221; cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing &#8220;beta&#8221; on hand hand-made ones or something&#8230;

        Since moving to Taffs Well, just outside of Cardiff, Viv and I have enjoyed fantastic views of the Garth. This mountain is the centre for the original true story of &#8220;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down A Mountain&#8221;, a book/film which I managed to catch on TV this week. Basically, it goes like this, the villagers of Taffs Well work together to try to prevent an English cartographer from leaving the village and classifying the Garth as a hill.

        I&#8217;ve long wondered why there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much happening in terms of community of the web professionals in wales. There is a vibrant collection of people sporting different skill sets in the area, yet as I can see not a lot of chat amongst everyone in between different groups. On a whim, I decided to create a facebook group &#8220;Cardiff Web Geeks&#8221; to try and get people to come out of their shells and actually participate in a bit of discussion about tech topics in wales.

        Wow, Apple have released a new touch version of the iPod (think the iPhone with no phone) as well as updating the classic iPod (160Gb!) and new nano versions. This actually means I&#8217;d be able to have an iPod which fits my entire music collection upon it with room to spare. I&#8217;ve waited a long time for that. The iPod touch also allows wireless browsing and download of new music via iTunes.

        I&#8217;ve heard a couple of rumours this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&#8217;s some discussion over on facereviews.com that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &#8220;social networks&#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for?

        The other evening I managed to stretch my back awkwardly and I&#8217;ve been feeling the repercussions of it ever since. It&#8217;s extremely painful to move my head, arm or neck and I&#8217;m getting really frustrated by not being able to sit at the computer without being uncomfortable. Wednesday night I was flat out in bed not able to move an inch, and little more of an improvement last night. It&#8217;s making me really tired and irritable.

        Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of Ryan Carsons Future of Web Applications Roadtrip. It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down.

        Now that the big day has passed, I thought I&#8217;d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is Go Ape.

        Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&#8217;s never had a home before and we&#8217;ve never owned it.
