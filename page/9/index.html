<p>The other evening I managed to stretch my back awkwardly and I’ve been feeling the repercussions of it ever since. It’s extremely painful to move my head, arm or neck and I’m getting really frustrated by not being able to sit at the computer without being uncomfortable. Wednesday night I was flat out in bed not able to move an inch, and little more of an improvement last night. It’s making me really tired and irritable. Grr!</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/08/08/fowa-roadtrip-bristol">FOWA Roadtrip Bristol</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">08 Aug 2007</div>
<p>Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of <a href="http://carsonified.com">Ryan Carsons</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Applications</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/raodtrip">Roadtrip</a>. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down. Luckily, at about 6.30pm the line opened up again and I made it over to Bristol. I&#8217;d met up with Evan Rudowski and Jo(?) of <a href="http://www.subhub.com">SubHub</a> prior at Cardiff station and therefore headed over with them.</p>
<p>It was a good evening, with me able to catch up with <a href="http://jontangerine.com">Jon</a> and <a href="http://dotjay.co.uk">Jon</a> of the <a href="http://gr0w.com">Grow Collective</a> (with whom I shall hopefully be working with very soon, but more on that later). I don&#8217;t think I ever used the free drink I was entitled too with my lovely check sticker Ryan graced me with. A similar event is happening in Cardiff on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip">10th September over in the bay</a>, if you&#8217;re a web type in wales you&#8217;d probably do well to check it out.</p>
<p>Update: there&#8217;s more info on the event on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/thanks-bristol/">Future of Web Apps blog</a>. I even made it into a couple of photos, albeit adorning a rucksack. The fire in Newport <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6936270.stm">completely destroyed a row of houses</a>. I guess I didn&#8217;t have it that bad&#8230;</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/07/22/my-stag-do">My Stag Do</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">22 Jul 2007</div>
<p>Now that the big day has passed, I thought I’d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is <a href="http://www.goape.co.uk/">Go Ape</a>. This was really great fun and definitely a little different than some of the other stag do’s I’ve been on. Basically, you attach yourself to a steel rope and move through a bunch of trees high up, except the route taken might not be as straight forward as a bridge. Give it a try, it defintely was worth the money… I also highly recommend watching the videos below for an idea of the action.</p>

<p>On the saturday afternoon, we travelled to er, somewhere to have a go at shooting some stuff. Don’t worry, it wasn’t ever alive. Well, you obviously need to know how to operate a 12 gauge before you get married, surely? The chap guiding us was a Lord and seemed rather keen on letting us all know about it, also how Nelson Mandela was a terrorist and he’d put him away, nice….</p>

<p>Anyway following an evening on the town due to being kicked out of our new pad for the girls to take over, Sunday we met up with the hen do to have a fairly surprisingly decent day at the beach (people even burnt!). Some people decided to bury me in rocks…but Viv rescued me. As people decided to head off, I was quite chuffed I’d got away without anything dodgy going down.</p>

<p>Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here – I’ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I’ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we’re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it’s never had a home before and we’ve never owned it. Anyway, suffice to say things are busy – which might explain my not being about. Sorry if you feel you’ve been missing out…</p>

<div class="author_meta">15 Jun 2007</div>
<p>The wonderful hackers of, er Britain. When I say we, I actually mean me because my wife to be has to head back to Abergavenny before me. Which means that actually I’ll be the only one able to make use of my free invite to see the rumble strips. Oh well.I’m actually a bit nervy about heading over – I have done an extreme lack of preparation in terms of programming and I’m going to be sleeping in a room full of nerds and pcs, or possibly not. I’m also pretty clueless of the many api’s about. Anyway, if you’re heading over and love t shirts, <a href="http://last.fm/user/i_wootten">music like me</a> or using the web to change the world for the better, I’d probably enjoy stuffing my face with pizza in front of you.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/06/03/google-developer-day">Google Developer Day</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 Jun 2007</div>
<p>I’ve just returned from my stint in the South East after being invited to attend <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/uk-home.html">Googles London Developer day</a> on thursday and remaining there to hang out in Haddenham for the weekend. Theres a ton of photo’s over on <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/developerday/GoogleDeveloperDayLondonUnitedKingdom/photo#5071383122600581538">a picasa web album</a> which has been built up from peoples pics. I even got interviewed regarding using the google web toolkit, but my experience was not exactly extended so I don’t know if it would get used at all. Essentially the event was used as a launchpad for a number of new pieces of kit that Google are introducing:<strong>Google Gears</strong> – Firstly, google gears was pitted as much the golden child of the day, with google demonstrating the new offline-enabling of appications which functions much the same within a browser without an available connection. We were shown this with the new offline functionality which Googles rss reader has built in. It looked to be a quite powerful tool for those who may have intermittent internet connections. For the most part though, I wonder how useful really is when the problem more obviously is about having any connection at all to give synchronisation in the first place or having a connection all the time. This was kind of inadvertedly demonstrated through the event having a rather dire internet connection and later through a Mountain view webcast where the demonstrater couldn’t get rid of his connection. The web toolkit <a href="http://googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com/2007/05/gwt-gears-up.html">now features gears funtionality</a> as well.<strong>Google Mapplets</strong> – Essentially a way of having several third-party google maps projected onto one map. So you could search say hotel rooms and weather conditions from a Met Office and Holiday in mapplet and see the two on the same map. Nifty, but I bet it might put a few people out of business…<strong>Google Mashup Editor</strong> – I hadn’t heard of this tool until the end of the day during the Mountain view webcast, but this is essentailly an editor to quickly produce mashups. You can read more of this <a href="http://code.google.com/gme">here</a>.Anyway, the whole day was great and Google even gave us a night in a fancy London bar too. I think the fish and chips served could have done with being about 10 times larger though. I met like-minded geeks, and thats never a bad thing.</p>

<p>Wow! A long time ago I signed up for <a href="http://googledeveloperday2007-uk.blogspot.com/">google’s developer day</a>, to be on their waiting list. I’d completely forgotten but just got an invite asking me if I wanted to come along. Crazy! First yahoo, now google!
