          <p>I should really write something about whats been going on over the Christmas hols, but I don&#8217;t want to waste any time which could be used for revision. What I will say though is that I&#8217;ve just discovered a sourceforge project called <a href="http://ming.sourceforge.net/">&#8220;Ming&#8221;</a> which allows for easy SWF (Flash) output with php.</p>
<p>This could come in really handy in that it could be used to generate templates with animated content, such as recent additions or news feeds in side blocks.</p>

          <p>After having been working like theres no tomorrow on other coursework, I&#8217;ve finally managed to come back to my project work.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve really not got very much productive work done on it aside from a few class diagrams and workflow routines which I&#8217;ve put together. I have been working on a prototype over the last month however in order to have that side of things produced on time. Currently it doesn&#8217;t do a lot more than add or delete users and needs to come a lot further before its something impressive which is worthy to be shown to my supervisor.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m spending this next week in producing the documents which I really should of put together a long time ago. I&#8217;ll have to hang around up here until the end of the week I think. I had made a start at writing the requirements spec but it was nothing more than a draft really.</p>
<p>Hopefully I will of finalised everything by the end of the week so I can have a more enjoyable christmas at home.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been totally caning it over the last week or so&#8230;. I&#8217;ve got this Opengl graphics project due in very soon, and I&#8217;ve been working like a bit of a bandit on it. On the other side of the coin, I&#8217;ve got a databases piece due in on the same day which I haven&#8217;t made a start on yet. Guess I&#8217;ll be doing that over the weekend. Those will be in next week and then I&#8217;ll have some time to get moving on my project again&#8230;.</p>
<p>I got a couple of pieces of coursework since I last wrote.. First I got full marks for Graphics, which I was quite chuffed about, but it was pretty easy. Secondly, I got my paradigms coursework back and was absolutely gutted as I only got like 55% (accounting for 20% of my overall mark). So I&#8217;ve already lost 10% without even beginning the exam. I&#8217;ve been a bit cut up about that for a while. Ah well, I&#8217;ll have to try and make it up on the exam. I did do pretty well on the last course I took with Ralph so the crazy amount of notes I&#8217;m taking must be doing some good.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been trying to make some headway on my cms project today in order to get ahead and not end up in the same situation as I had in the second year. Seeing as I have a distinct lack of all things coursework related at the mo, I thought that would be a diamond idea. Unfortunately my knowledge of what now goes into a project is somewhat sparse, and I&#8217;m finding it a right job knowing where to tackle first. I need to churn out some sort of prototype before the semester is up in order to show it to my supervisor at the start of next year.</p>

          <p>Having just installed the latest version of wordpress over b2 (thus ruining said previous mood plugin) I now have a working image upload abilities! Just to give you an idea of what goes on up in Cardiff, have a look at this pic of me and my long lost brother.</p>
