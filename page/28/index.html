          <p>I&#8217;ve been following a number of so called &#8220;web 2.0&#8243; companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It&#8217;s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I&#8217;d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I&#8217;ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I&#8217;d be very interested. I&#8217;m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck&#8230;&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">24 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I thought I&#8217;d pose this as a question because I&#8217;m unsure if this is indeed my final year. It&#8217;s quite strange to think at the end of this thing I&#8217;m actually going to have to find some work somewhere another. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated from whomever. I&#8217;m looking for Â£50k/yr involving part time work from home, company car, but then I think the rest of the world is too.</p>
<p>I go through the enrolment thing tomorrow, with whatever follows throughout the rest of the year on the cards too. You know, taking a few labs and tutorials, Christmas, New Years, some more labs and tutorials, my 26th birthday (sheesh!) getting wed&#8230;&#8230;..I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m selling my car, which has been with me for the last 4/5 years and always been very reliable. It&#8217;s a very nice Vauxhall Corsa 1.5 TD in red, for more details, check freeads <a href="http://cars.uk.freeads.net/1994_L_reg_VAUXHALL_CORSA-229570.htm">here</a> and drop me an email either through freeads or this website if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sad to see the thing go, but as I now have no need for it due to the acquiring of my own personal chauffeur, it seems a bit uneconomical to hang on to it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been suffering at the hands of the sheer size of the web recently. Just starting off at popurls yields many hours spent just browsing randomly across many, many web buzz sites. Although its all very interesting, its not particularly useful to my research, or in fact my own projects.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I spent a large amount of time last week, after realising that I could very easy install compiz and XGL on my machine at uni, trying to install it upon my home machine. As its 64 bit, and owing to previous problems I&#8217;d experienced installing 64 bit applications (like linux for instance), I spent the best part of 2 days attempting to install both, before caving and completely giving up.I got to the stage where XGL is installed properly and seems to work ok, but the compiz gnome window manager isn&#8217;t working properly, meaning I have no borders to any panes I create.It&#8217;s not like I need a whizzy 4 sided cube spinning around, but I thought it might be fun&#8230;</p>
