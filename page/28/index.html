      <div class="author_meta">24 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I thought I&#8217;d pose this as a question because I&#8217;m unsure if this is indeed my final year. It&#8217;s quite strange to think at the end of this thing I&#8217;m actually going to have to find some work somewhere another. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated from whomever. I&#8217;m looking for Â£50k/yr involving part time work from home, company car, but then I think the rest of the world is too.</p>
<p>I go through the enrolment thing tomorrow, with whatever follows throughout the rest of the year on the cards too. You know, taking a few labs and tutorials, Christmas, New Years, some more labs and tutorials, my 26th birthday (sheesh!) getting wed&#8230;&#8230;..I&#8217;ll stop there.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;m selling my car, which has been with me for the last 4/5 years and always been very reliable. It&#8217;s a very nice Vauxhall Corsa 1.5 TD in red, for more details, check freeads <a href="http://cars.uk.freeads.net/1994_L_reg_VAUXHALL_CORSA-229570.htm">here</a> and drop me an email either through freeads or this website if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sad to see the thing go, but as I now have no need for it due to the acquiring of my own personal chauffeur, it seems a bit uneconomical to hang on to it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been suffering at the hands of the sheer size of the web recently. Just starting off at popurls yields many hours spent just browsing randomly across many, many web buzz sites. Although its all very interesting, its not particularly useful to my research, or in fact my own projects.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2006</div>

          <p>I spent a large amount of time last week, after realising that I could very easy install compiz and XGL on my machine at uni, trying to install it upon my home machine. As its 64 bit, and owing to previous problems I&#8217;d experienced installing 64 bit applications (like linux for instance), I spent the best part of 2 days attempting to install both, before caving and completely giving up.I got to the stage where XGL is installed properly and seems to work ok, but the compiz gnome window manager isn&#8217;t working properly, meaning I have no borders to any panes I create.It&#8217;s not like I need a whizzy 4 sided cube spinning around, but I thought it might be fun&#8230;</p>

          <p>Hi there, we&#8217;ve not spoken in a while. How&#8217;s you?It seems I&#8217;ve been succumbing to a lifestyle of late that I wish I would never end up at &#8211; that of working within a &#8220;routine&#8221;. I must be getting old. The whole of last week seemed a little bit of a drain, working my ass off trying to get tiny parts of code to work properly in the day and the rest of the time being tired that I was staying up late to give myself alone time in the evenings. The day and evening seem to blur to become a big mess when I&#8217;m working hard, I lose all concept of what should really be important to me and where my efforts should really be put.Anyway, I&#8217;ve been up to lots other than working, went off to greenbelt last week, which was unexpectedly cool (especially the Ukelele Orchestra!) and spent this weekend with very little time spare once it had all been used up with meeting people, socialising and whatnot. Oh deary me, whats going on? Do I finally have a life?</p>
