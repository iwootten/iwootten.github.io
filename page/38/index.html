          <p>Some of the thoughts in <a href="http://www.beingbarbara.com/?p=290">this post</a> over at Barbara&#8217;s really hit home with me today. I don&#8217;t often take time to reflect on pointers like these but the majority of them are ringing alarm bells about some aspect of my life at the moment.</p>

          <p>From a sample upon the <a href="http://www.solidsteel.org/moneyshot/DJ_Moneyshot_-_Dischandler.mp3">dischandler</a> (DJ Moneyshot):</p>
<p>&#8220;No one wants to be a failure, no one wants a life constantly filled with worry, fear and frustration. Therefore you must remember to reap that which you sow. If you sow negative thoughts, your life will be filled with negative things. If you sow positive thoughts, your life will be cheerful, successful and positive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so sure how this pads out in real life&#8230;</p>

          <p>So, I&#8217;ve had not a lot of response to my situation with ebuyer of late, but this recent email I recieved from them sent me over the edge &#8211; I&#8217;d sent them 7 emails and phoned 2 times with a 40 min wait prior to recieving this.<br>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br>Microsoft OEM Windows XP Professional x64 Edition &#8211; 1Pk</p>
<p>Dear Sir / Madam,</p>
<p>Thank you for informing us of your missing item. When we are believed to have short shipped an<br>item, we carry out a series of checks to make sure that the item has not been dispatched.</p>
<p>Our first check is to recreate the order in our warehouse, and match that weight against the weight<br>of your order when it was shipped. We have carried out this check, and the<br>weights show we have shipped the item. This means we have to further investigate the missing item, by<br>checking the parcel with Citylink, our couriers, and possibly reporting to the relevant<br>authorities should something seem suspect.</p>
<p>We have performed these checks and believe goods to have shipped on this occasion. However, if an<br>incorect item/s have been delivered, please advise as this will account for the weight check and we<br>can investigate further.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and co-operation in this matter.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Ebuyer Customer Support</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>In response to your email of 03/11/05:</p>
<p>Dear ebuyer,</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested to know why exactly you think I&#8217;d make a complaint that an item had not been delivered if it had? I have been a loyal customer of ebuyers since 2002 &#8211; making over Â£3200 worth of purchases over that time! &#8211; all of which further adds to the horrendous way in which you are treating me, I am extremely annoyed.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d also add that this method of checking weight descrepencies between items is horrendously flawed in this matter &#8211; you believe you can account for the difference of a weight of a unboxed oem cd and leaflet, by recreating it in the warehouse?! The weight of these items is comparable to the air-packing which you ship with every order, ie nothing!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d fully read my enotes you would see that I&#8217;ve told you the item has not been shipped, in every note I left, there we no boxes opened or damaged, so looking into your delivery companies actions seems rather pointless &#8211; I&#8217;ve had to purchase this elsewhere due to the decided lack of response on ebuyers part, incurring further cost to myself. In the course of a month, you have spent your time not listening to me, lying to me upon the phone, giving me information which I already know and have informed you of.</p>
<p>Suffice to say I shall not be purchasing from you in the future and by the looks of things may have to employ the services of a solicitor in order to retrieve my money anyway.</p>
<p>This situation is ridiculous &#8211; I expect a full refund immediately, I was initially told this matter would be resolved in a day, and your continued lack of action is deplorable.</p>
<p>Mr I.M.Wootten</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br>Dear Mr Wootten,</p>
<p>The email which has been sent to you so we can gain further information to assist us with our enquiries. The weights of the parcels are showing as that the item has shipped. Can you please advise if you received an incorrect item or was any of the packaging damaged on arrival.</p>
<p>Kind Regards<br>Sarah<br>Ebuyer Customer Support Team</p>

The item is &#8220;Missing&#8221;. I had no extra items delivered, no boxes opened or damaged, I had the DVDRW Drive, Thermal Grease, Nero Express CD OEM in one package and the Logitech Keyboard bundle in another in the last consignment delivery.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br>Dear Mr Wootten,</p>
<p>Your card has now been refunded. The funds will be in your account in the next 3-4 working days.</p>
<p>Kind Regards<br>Sarah<br>Ebuyer Customer Support Team</p>

      <div class="author_meta">30 Oct 2005</div>

          <p>I went round to Living Stones last night for a bit of a lads night with Jon, Dan, Rob and Joe for music and watching Batman Begins. I took a number of Cd&#8217;s for Dan and I to listen to, which basically reflected the &#8220;base&#8221; around which the majority of all my other music stems from. It&#8217;s quite odd trying to verbalise how a particular song makes you feel, why you feel uplifted by it, how it captures a particular moment in time, thought, etc etc. It&#8217;s more odd because I don&#8217;t tend to talk about my music tastes much and coming to terms with what mainstream music means to me is surreal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not who we are, but what we do that defines us&#8230;&#8221;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">24 Oct 2005</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been attending a fair few &#8216;live&#8217; gigs recently as oppose to the frequenting of clubs in Cardiff. The first was the fantastic <a href="http://www.royksopp.com/">R&ouml;yksopp</a>, whom I was dubious to see alone, but glad I did. Quite frankly they were as great live as I could possibly hope for and the addition of the huge inflatable tape and scrolling info about each song added to the experience.</p>
<p>More recently, I got to see <a href="http://www.bowlingforsoup.com">&#8220;Bowling for Soup&#8221;</a> at union on Friday, which allowed me to experience the &#8216;delights&#8217; of teen punk as well as some awful &#8220;post-punk laptop (c)rap&#8221; from <a href="http://www.mclars.com">Mc Lars</a> who seemed confused as to where exactly Cardiff featured in the UK. When <a href="http://www.americanhi-fi.com/">American Hi-Fi</a> landed as support, the kiddies got a tad excited and decided to vent their frustrations of the last week before half-term by forming a number of mosh pits and jumping into one another. Not fully understanding this myself, we backed off to safer havens and observed further stupidity from there.</p>
<p>Saturday was a return to old pastures for me, providing a warm-up for <a href="http://www.todah.co.uk/2005/">Todah</a>, who are as great live as their website suggests. The venue (the old apostolic church in swansea), was highly unique allowing me to play in the most random room ever as the youth were crammed in like sardines. It was great fun, reminding me of the older youth events we used to hold in Yeovil prior to the move into the new building. It was also awesome to get paid to perform and enjoy worship. I decided to give Heledd a buzz whilst I was there (possibly a little belated I realise) and we ended up going for a fab Indian with the band after, with much laughter involved. Unfortunately it seems some CV&#8217;ers might have inferred a little too much from the outing, (big stick, wrong end), but to be fair it&#8217;s nice to know that people pay enough of an interest in my life to be bothered by that.</p>
