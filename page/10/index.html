<h1><a href="/2007/06/03/google-developer-day">Google Developer Day</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 Jun 2007</div>
<p>I’ve just returned from my stint in the South East after being invited to attend <a href="http://code.google.com/events/developerday/uk-home.html">Googles London Developer day</a> on thursday and remaining there to hang out in Haddenham for the weekend. Theres a ton of photo’s over on <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/developerday/GoogleDeveloperDayLondonUnitedKingdom/photo#5071383122600581538">a picasa web album</a> which has been built up from peoples pics. I even got interviewed regarding using the google web toolkit, but my experience was not exactly extended so I don’t know if it would get used at all. Essentially the event was used as a launchpad for a number of new pieces of kit that Google are introducing:<strong>Google Gears</strong> – Firstly, google gears was pitted as much the golden child of the day, with google demonstrating the new offline-enabling of appications which functions much the same within a browser without an available connection. We were shown this with the new offline functionality which Googles rss reader has built in. It looked to be a quite powerful tool for those who may have intermittent internet connections. For the most part though, I wonder how useful really is when the problem more obviously is about having any connection at all to give synchronisation in the first place or having a connection all the time. This was kind of inadvertedly demonstrated through the event having a rather dire internet connection and later through a Mountain view webcast where the demonstrater couldn’t get rid of his connection. The web toolkit <a href="http://googlewebtoolkit.blogspot.com/2007/05/gwt-gears-up.html">now features gears funtionality</a> as well.<strong>Google Mapplets</strong> – Essentially a way of having several third-party google maps projected onto one map. So you could search say hotel rooms and weather conditions from a Met Office and Holiday in mapplet and see the two on the same map. Nifty, but I bet it might put a few people out of business…<strong>Google Mashup Editor</strong> – I hadn’t heard of this tool until the end of the day during the Mountain view webcast, but this is essentailly an editor to quickly produce mashups. You can read more of this <a href="http://code.google.com/gme">here</a>.Anyway, the whole day was great and Google even gave us a night in a fancy London bar too. I think the fish and chips served could have done with being about 10 times larger though. I met like-minded geeks, and thats never a bad thing.</p>

<p>Wow! A long time ago I signed up for <a href="http://googledeveloperday2007-uk.blogspot.com/">google’s developer day</a>, to be on their waiting list. I’d completely forgotten but just got an invite asking me if I wanted to come along. Crazy! First yahoo, now google! I’m very, very excited.Obviously I am not more excited about either of these days than my wedding day… <img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>I just heard I’ve got invited to <a href="http://www.hackday.org/">Hackday</a>! That’s totally awesome, I’m really excited! I signed up half expecting to be told to “go jump” and I’d contacted the administrators of the list due to hearing nothing about it and some confusing responses at first – but I just got my proper invite. Woo! – Impressive as I didn’t put much of an explanation of my work on there. I guess it was my sob story about my ongoing PhD.Props go to <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">Tom Coates</a> whose blog first pointed it out for me. Oh, and the fact he maybe has something to do with organising the event!Interestingly, this is a week before my stag do and a week after my moving house – which means I probably won’t be getting much sleep in June.<!-- Hack Day button 180px wide by 105px tall --></p>

<p><a href="http://mashable.com/">Mashable</a> is reporting that a <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/05/04/microsoft-yahoo/">Microsoft-Yahoo merger may be on the cards</a>, which is a fairly bizarre prospect.</p>

<p>The price? $50 Billion, is Yahoo only worth 30 odd YouTubes? I for one think not.</p>

<p>Browsing across <a href="http://matt.west.co.tt">Matt Westcotts</a> site yielded <a href="http://matt.west.co.tt/music/through-yeovil/" title="Yeovil Rocks">this particular gem</a>.

<p>Did you know that not only can <a href="http://rightmove.co.uk">http://rightmove.co.uk</a> hunt down all the prices of current houses for sale in your area, it will also give you the prices that houses have gone for for the last 7 years? I didn’t, but tonight I enjoyed checking out the fact that someone bought a house in my road for £40k in January (but I think either this is a typo, or the place is a hole!) and in 2001 I could have got one for £10k. If only I’d taken Mum and Dad on that offer of a property back in my first year of Uni, I’d have made an absolute bundle.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/04/12/joost-beta">Joost Beta</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">12 Apr 2007</div>
<p>This afternoon I was quite chuffed to discover that I&#8217;d been selected for a Joost beta invite. Joost is, in a nutshell, TV for the web . Kind of the opposite to that Current TV channel on Virgin Media. I&#8217;ve been playing with it this evening, mainly perusing the XL-Recordings and gaming channels.It all seems very good &#8211; a good seelction of channels (for me) straight off, with the ability to search Joost&#8217;s catalog of channels and add more to your collection. The interface (see shots below) is pretty swish and the advertising between shows (The maximum I endured was 2 * 10 second clips) does not detract from the channel content too much. Presumeably these are targeted advertisements, though it didn&#8217;t seem so from the few I watched. There is also the ability to interact in channels and a widget interface. I must point out that Joost is a legal service &#8211; I&#8217;m not in the business of pirating. It uses P2P (peer-to-peer), to distribute content to users &#8211; I had hardly any lags on my measly 2MB connection, although the full-screen content is compressed at quite a low bit rate.Apparently, the Mac version of joost works with the Apple remote, which I could see would make this a very pleasant experience. I think I&#8217;ll be playing with this toy a fair few more times this week.<a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.JPG" title="Joost"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Joost" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.JPG" title="joostinterface2.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface2.JPG" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.JPG" title="joostinterface3.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface3.JPG" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.JPG" title="joostinterface4.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface4.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>Doing household bills is extremely boring. I just spent two hours dividing up the phone bill and working out who owes what. If marriage brings me anything, at least it will bring me less of a headache when it comes to doing the bills.</p>
