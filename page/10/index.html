        Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of Ryan Carsons Future of Web Applications Roadtrip. It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down.

        Now that the big day has passed, I thought I&#8217;d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is Go Ape.

        Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&#8217;s never had a home before and we&#8217;ve never owned it.

        The wonderful hackers of, er Britain. When I say we, I actually mean me because my wife to be has to head back to Abergavenny before me. Which means that actually I&#8217;ll be the only one able to make use of my free invite to see the rumble strips. Oh well.I&#8217;m actually a bit nervy about heading over &#8211; I have done an extreme lack of preparation in terms of programming and I&#8217;m going to be sleeping in a room full of nerds and pcs, or possibly not.

        I&#8217;ve just returned from my stint in the South East after being invited to attend Googles London Developer day on thursday and remaining there to hang out in Haddenham for the weekend. Theres a ton of photo&#8217;s over on a picasa web album which has been built up from peoples pics. I even got interviewed regarding using the google web toolkit, but my experience was not exactly extended so I don&#8217;t know if it would get used at all.

        Wow! A long time ago I signed up for google&#8217;s developer day, to be on their waiting list. I&#8217;d completely forgotten but just got an invite asking me if I wanted to come along. Crazy! First yahoo, now google! I&#8217;m very, very excited.Obviously I am not more excited about either of these days than my wedding day&#8230;

        I just heard I&#8217;ve got invited to Hackday! That&#8217;s totally awesome, I&#8217;m really excited! I signed up half expecting to be told to &#8220;go jump&#8221; and I&#8217;d contacted the administrators of the list due to hearing nothing about it and some confusing responses at first &#8211; but I just got my proper invite. Woo! &#8211; Impressive as I didn&#8217;t put much of an explanation of my work on there. I guess it was my sob story about my ongoing PhD.
