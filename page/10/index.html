      <div class="author_meta">24 Jul 2010</div>

          <p>It&#8217;s been well over a month since I attended <a href="http://sciencehackday.com">science hack day</a> and I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d put out some notes on my time there. Rather than do a run down of the event, for which I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s far more comprehensive blog posts available already, I thought I&#8217;d share my experiences based on attendance of a number of different hack events I&#8217;ve been to over the years. I went with the full intention of doing some hardcore hacking, but didn&#8217;t entirely meet my own expectations. Here&#8217;s my top tips, for now not to do a hack day:</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Don&#8217;t bother coming prepared &#8211; You&#8217;ve got 24 hours, and you&#8217;re bound to be the best coder at the event. You&#8217;ll have a unique idea and get that app finished in no time! No, far better to kick back and relax before setting on your way and conduct your research on what&#8217;s possible when you arrive.</li>
<li>2: Arrive fashionably late &#8211; 24 hours is ages, and you know all the apis that presentations are going to cover. Nothing says &#8220;I&#8217;m superior&#8221; more than waltzing in a couple of hours late to the event whilst everyone else has been busy sweating it out already.</li>
<li>3: Keep your distance from other attendees &#8211; Your idea is your own and you&#8217;ll want to claim all the glory for it after the event. Where&#8217;s the glory in letting people know you&#8217;re one of 10 people involved? Keep your app under wraps before that all important presentation at the end, the audience will be in total awe of you and flock to your side afterwards.</li>
<li>4: Be sure to leave the event &#8211; You enjoy your sleep right? Why lose it by camping out on some office floor space, when you can head home to your comfy bed or to a hotel and return in the morning? This way, you also get to avoid all that small talk with big name, high profile coders who will belittle you with their outstanding knowledge of their own companies apis.</li>
<li>5: Have your fill of the free refreshments &#8211; Free beer and pizza? Wow, these are a must for any late night software development project. There&#8217;s nothing better than feeling stuffed full of dominos and slightly rosy whilst trying to get your brain working at full throttle.</li>
<li>6: Don&#8217;t prepare for your presentation &#8211; You&#8217;ll need every last second for building your app and the presentation is only a minute long. You might as well just attempt something of the cuff. Don&#8217;t worry about connections to your laptop, because those things always work and organisers like <a href="http://adactio.com/">adactio</a> are most amicable about trying to organise it for you along with 30 others at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I attended <a href="http://sciencehackday.com">Science Hack Day</a> and collaborated with a <a href="http://openobjects.blogspot.com">Mia</a>, <a href="http://dharmafly.com">Prem</a>, <a href="http://tommorris.org/blog/">Tom Morris</a>, <a href="http://yaili.com/">Inayaili de León</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/goodonpaper">Andy McMillan</a> and Richard Boulton in order to build an app titled <a href="http://dharmafly.com/scihack">&#8220;The Revolutionaries&#8221;</a>. Both Inayaili and Andy I never even spoke to and it was only through Prem&#8217;s organisation that the app came through in the end. I spent 2 hours of the event commuting to and from the guardian&#8217;s offices and 1 more stuck in a stationary tunnel in the dark. I&#8217;m glad that a made an effort though as the <a href="http://dharmafly.com/revolutionaries/">net result was a great app</a>, which even won a little prize. I probably won&#8217;t be heeding much of the above advice at future events.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2010/06/15/installing-mplayer-on-snow-leopard">Installing MPlayer on Snow Leopard</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">15 Jun 2010</div>

          <p>Here&#8217;s a heads up for anyone installing MPlayer on Snow Leopard. I&#8217;ve been playing a fair amount with tools recently and inevitably ending up running round in circles in installing, compiling, setting flags etc. Here&#8217;s a quick one liner param for anyone compiling mplayer (and freetype as its dependency) which people on Snow Leopard may find useful.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll first need to download latest versions of <a href="http://www.freetype.org/download.html">freetype</a> and <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">mplayer</a>. Uncompress both. <div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">cd</span> freetype
.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>configure
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span> <span style="color: #007800;">CXXFLAGS</span>=<span style="color: #ff0000;">&quot;-m64&quot;</span>
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">install</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div></p>
<p>(Check here that the command &#8220;file /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.dylib&#8221; returns &#8220;Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64&#8243;) <div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">cd</span> mplayer-checkout-<span style="color: #000000;">2010</span>-06-<span style="color: #000000;">14</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">tar</span> <span style="color: #660033;">-xjvf</span> mplayer-checkout-snapshot.tar.bz2
.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>configure
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span>
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">install</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div></p>
<p>The killer here for me was sudo make CXXFLAGS=&#8221;-m64&#8243;. Without it, mplayer&#8217;s make command failed with &#8220;ld: warning: in /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.dylib, file is not of required architecture&#8221;. I&#8217;ve encountered problems like this before, where the file is compiled for 32 Bit leopard rather than 64, but they&#8217;re usually solved with setting a CFLAGS variable.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">18 Apr 2010</div>

          <p>Something I&#8217;ve thought I&#8217;d like to have on my site for a while is a list of movies that I&#8217;ve recently seen and some brief opinions on them. I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I would go about this for films I see at the cinema, or whether I could muster the stamina to review every single film I&#8217;ve watched, but a recent television upgrade has now meant I&#8217;ve got the opportunity to do this.</p>
<p>Our television came with a years subscription to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">lovefilm</a>, which means I can now track our past film watching history. At four blu rays a month, that&#8217;s quite a lot of films over the course of the year.</p>
<p>Love Film have recently opened up their doors with an api and <a href="http://developer.lovefilm.com">developer area</a> (which unfortunately is not particularly active at the moment). Anyway &#8211; their documentation is pretty thorough and has made the process of creating a wordpress plugin to display my past rentals really simple. You can see some example output of it on my site <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/filmstream">over here</a>.</p>
<p>You can grab the plugin over <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/filmstream.zip">here</a>. It&#8217;s authenticated by oauth (for which you&#8217;ll require php on your blog host to be compiled with oauth enabled) and so will bounce you over to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">lovefilm</a> to ask for access to your account, but after that will update on a daily basis. Just click &#8220;Fetch Items&#8221; on the filmstream admin page and stick <code>&lt;!--filmstream_content--&gt;</code> in any page to display a table containing all your past rentals. There&#8217;s no options to speak of right now, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be extending it in the future.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">21 Mar 2010</div>

          <p><a href="http://www.mixbooth.com">Mixbooth</a> is a dj mix hosting service I created several years ago. At the time there wasn&#8217;t a lot around in terms of options for allowing anyone to share them. You either had to exchange it upon a site filled with advertisements, or host it on your own space which might mean you&#8217;d breach your server bandwidth for any given month. I decided to use some space I had available at next to nothing to build something that might be of use to myself and any other dj whom saw fit to use it. It was good at the time and I got quite a buzz out of seeing new uploads appearing and hearing what others had created. I took the decision to end use of <a href="http://www.mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> after about a year of having a couple of mixes a week uploaded. This was mainly due to academic commitments at the time.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been working on a rebuild of it for some time now. So I&#8217;m letting it loose on those who might be interested. I&#8217;m no longer hosting mixes, but hopefully exchanging useful info on them and those artists who feature within and allowing people to chat about them. It&#8217;s not everything I want it to be right now, but hopefully will serve to a use to djs other than myself. If you want to have a play, head to <a href="http://www.mixbooth.com/signup">www.mixbooth.com/signup</a> and I&#8217;ll get an invite out. I&#8217;ll also be tweeting updates via <a href="http://twitter.com/mixbooth">@mixbooth</a>.</p>
