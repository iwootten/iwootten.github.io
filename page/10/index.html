<p>Did you know that not only can <a href="http://rightmove.co.uk">http://rightmove.co.uk</a> hunt down all the prices of current houses for sale in your area, it will also give you the prices that houses have gone for for the last 7 years? I didn’t, but tonight I enjoyed checking out the fact that someone bought a house in my road for £40k in January (but I think either this is a typo, or the place is a hole!) and in 2001 I could have got one for £10k. If only I’d taken Mum and Dad on that offer of a property back in my first year of Uni, I’d have made an absolute bundle.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/04/12/joost-beta">Joost Beta</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">12 Apr 2007</div>
<p>This afternoon I was quite chuffed to discover that I&#8217;d been selected for a Joost beta invite. Joost is, in a nutshell, TV for the web . Kind of the opposite to that Current TV channel on Virgin Media. I&#8217;ve been playing with it this evening, mainly perusing the XL-Recordings and gaming channels.It all seems very good &#8211; a good seelction of channels (for me) straight off, with the ability to search Joost&#8217;s catalog of channels and add more to your collection. The interface (see shots below) is pretty swish and the advertising between shows (The maximum I endured was 2 * 10 second clips) does not detract from the channel content too much. Presumeably these are targeted advertisements, though it didn&#8217;t seem so from the few I watched. There is also the ability to interact in channels and a widget interface. I must point out that Joost is a legal service &#8211; I&#8217;m not in the business of pirating. It uses P2P (peer-to-peer), to distribute content to users &#8211; I had hardly any lags on my measly 2MB connection, although the full-screen content is compressed at quite a low bit rate.Apparently, the Mac version of joost works with the Apple remote, which I could see would make this a very pleasant experience. I think I&#8217;ll be playing with this toy a fair few more times this week.<a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.JPG" title="Joost"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface1.thumbnail.JPG" alt="Joost" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.JPG" title="joostinterface2.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface2.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface2.JPG" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.JPG" title="joostinterface3.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface3.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface3.JPG" /></a><a href="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.JPG" title="joostinterface4.JPG"><img src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/joostinterface4.thumbnail.JPG" alt="joostinterface4.JPG" /></a></p>

<p>Doing household bills is extremely boring. I just spent two hours dividing up the phone bill and working out who owes what. If marriage brings me anything, at least it will bring me less of a headache when it comes to doing the bills.</p>

<p>Currently <a href="http://vivvyenna.com">Viv</a> and I are planning our wedding for later in the year, which aside from being the most exciting thing ever, is really, really stressful. Apparently though, there are <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/jobs/index.php?job=84">wed designers</a> about, though I never realised.</p>

<p>Threadless has launched <a href="http://threadlesskids.com">threadlesskids.com</a> – like threadless, but for kids. I suppose that should come in handy for Jake and Shondis <a href="http://jakeandshondi.com/index/35/The_new_addition">recent announcement</a>. Anyway, it looks wicked – its amazing how the kids stuff costs more than adult though! My friends told me kids are expensive.</p>

<p>If anyone else like me is considering working in the uk “web 2.0″ market, and finds the posts on common job boards clogged up with all the jobs from america, the small job board I have created and posted online might be a help. You’ll find it over at: <a href="http://webtyrant.com/jobs">http://webtyrant.com/jobs</a>. It aggregates some common job boards together like 37Signals and ThinkVitamin, but removes anything but those located in the UK.</p>

<p>pMachine has changed its name to <a href="http://ellislab.com">Ellislab</a>, and are <a href="http://ellislab.com">sporting a shiny new website for all to see</a>. The reason for the change is the expansion over the last 6 years to encompass products which don’t fall under the same banner now. I’m glad to see that the <a href="http://codeigniter.com">CodeIgniter</a> website has got a facelift. <a href="http://31three.com/">31three</a> did the hard graft on the design and <a href="http://ellislab.com">they</a> all <a href="http://expressionengine.com">look</a> <a href="http://codeigniter.com">awesome</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/03/08/openid-the-end-of-multiple-passwords">OpenID &#8211; The end of multiple passwords?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">08 Mar 2007</div>
<p>I’ve been hearing some really good stuff about <a href="http://openid.net">openID</a> recently. For those who don’t know, this is a online identity standard which promises to be the end of having multiple passwords at just about every single website you visit. It’s recently risen to light with the adoption by <a href="http://wordpress.com/blog/2007/03/06/openid/">WordPress.com</a> as a provider and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/20/kevin-rose-at-fowa-digg-adopts-openid/">digg</a> as an adopter.<a href="http://webwebusability.wordpress.com/2007/03/07/wordpress-openid-not-really/">Complaints</a> against wordpress.com’s non-allowance of logins with openID’s created anywhere else than wordpress.com seem quite well founded. For those whom wordpress.com is not their original openID provider, it means that creation of these accounts will go unused and the identity problem seems to be perpetuated somewhat. If you do have your own domain, you can go ahead and <a href="http://webworkerdaily.com/2007/03/07/use-your-own-url-not-wordpresscoms-as-your-openid">create your own openID account there</a>, but you won’t be able to sign into wordpress.com with it.I had an idea off of the back of coming up with a memorable name for an application which makes use of openID as I read this this morning, but after a look around, it seems its <a href="http://fabricoffolly.blogspot.com/2007/03/to-z-of-online-profile-aggregators.html">already been done to death</a>. Alas, this is always the way. The offering by the PhD students over at <a href="http://claimid.com">claimID</a> looks great and is just the sort of thing I’ve been looking for. I may give it a bash at some point, although someones comment that it looked too much like “chlamydia.com”, probably would put me off putting it down on a cv.There’s lots of useful examples and information at <a href="http://www.openidenabled.com/">openID enabled</a>. You can see a short (5 min) video about openID <a href="http://ignitenight.blip.tv/file/154407/">here</a>, presented by Scott Kveton, CEO of <a href="http://janrain.com/">JanRain</a>, who build identity services for the web.</p>
