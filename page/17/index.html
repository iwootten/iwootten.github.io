      <div class="author_meta">22 Jul 2007</div>

          <p>Now that the big day has passed, I thought I&#8217;d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is <a href="http://www.goape.co.uk/">Go Ape</a>. This was really great fun and definitely a little different than some of the other stag do&#8217;s I&#8217;ve been on. Basically, you attach yourself to a steel rope and move through a bunch of trees high up, except the route taken might not be as straight forward as a bridge. Give it a try, it defintely was worth the money&#8230; I also highly recommend watching the videos below for an idea of the action.</p>
<p>On the saturday afternoon, we travelled to er, somewhere to have a go at shooting some stuff. Don&#8217;t worry, it wasn&#8217;t ever alive. Well, you obviously need to know how to operate a 12 gauge before you get married, surely? The chap guiding us was a Lord and seemed rather keen on letting us all know about it, also how Nelson Mandela was a terrorist and he&#8217;d put him away, nice&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway following an evening on the town due to being kicked out of our new pad for the girls to take over, Sunday we met up with the hen do to have a fairly surprisingly decent day at the beach (people even burnt!). Some people decided to bury me in rocks&#8230;but Viv rescued me. As people decided to head off, I was quite chuffed I&#8217;d got away without anything dodgy going down.</p>

          <p>Is a question you may have asked yourself once or twice on the absence of any written word on this site. Well, aside from not being here &#8211; I&#8217;ve been doing many things including moving house from my home of 3 years, playing a small part in organising a wedding and actually getting married (I know!). I&#8217;ve also just returned from honeymoon with wife in tow and now we&#8217;re trying to figure out where all our stuff should go when it&#8217;s never had a home before and we&#8217;ve never owned it. Anyway, suffice to say things are busy &#8211; which might explain my not being about. Sorry if you feel you&#8217;ve been missing out&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 Jun 2007</div>

          <p>The wonderful hackers of, er Britain. When I say we, I actually mean me because my wife to be has to head back to Abergavenny before me. Which means that actually I&#8217;ll be the only one able to make use of my free invite to see the rumble strips. Oh well.I&#8217;m actually a bit nervy about heading over &#8211; I have done an extreme lack of preparation in terms of programming and I&#8217;m going to be sleeping in a room full of nerds and pcs, or possibly not. I&#8217;m also pretty clueless of the many api&#8217;s about. Anyway, if you&#8217;re heading over and love t shirts, <a href="http://last.fm/user/i_wootten">music like me</a> or using the web to change the world for the better, I&#8217;d probably enjoy stuffing my face with pizza in front of you.</p>
