      <div class="author_meta">07 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>FInally, after a grand total of 10 months, I have a 64bit version of Ubuntu Linux working upon my home machine.This is great news, not only does it mean that I have a wonderful OS to try out for size, but that I can easily convert my subversion server code and latex source to my machine.As I&#8217;ve never mentioned it before, I&#8217;ll detail what the problem was here. First up, the graphics card didn&#8217;t have drivers which were working which meant that my X800 was pretty pathetic to be quite honest with you. There was a fairly simple solution through apt, which would have been nice if&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;the network card on my A8N-VM CSM was working properly, which it wasn&#8217;t, due to use of an NFORCE chipset. A build of some drivers were neccessary, which required adding a load of packages (simple if apt were working!).Anyway, several days of man hours later, and this ubuntu thing works wonderfully. If you&#8217;re having similar troubles with this board, its probably best to use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvNetInstallation" title="Ubuntu NVNet installation">this page</a> for guidance.</p>

          <p>You&#8217;d think that thieves would be content who&#8217;d bent my door back along to try and nick my car, realising actually I have nothing of value. Or that by monitoring my movements over a period of time, the opportune time to get into it would be when I went away to Dublin, Chicago or Singapore for weeks on end. Apparently not, in fact, they think its such a prime example of Vauxhalls lack of security that they would in fact like to come back and try to nick it by bending out the other door right when I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m half tempted to leave a note saying &#8220;theres nothing of value in here, honest&#8221; but I fear it would make it all the more amusing to the little wotsits.</p>
<p>Nothing taken except my self esteem from the last week unfortunately. That and the badge of a &pound;60k Merc near the rec.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">27 Jul 2006</div>

          <p>Yesterday I got a little annoyed about the fact that it seemed as if <a href="http://play.com">play</a> had forgotten all details of my existence and telling me my email address was wrong. After sending a little letter off to them complaining yesterday evening, I realised after their response that actually I&#8217;d altered my saved email a little while before. I went ahead and placed my order of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375063/">Sideways</a> this morning which I&#8217;d expected to be fairly good due to the rave reviews I&#8217;d heard of it.</p>
<p>Going to the Matthias&#8217; for tea revealed that they had also made the purchase, so we decided to watch it this evening. Oh dear, oh dear. I can&#8217;t say this was my most favourite film ever and has to rank up there with &#8220;Being John Malkovich&#8221; for dodgy purchases of mine. It would have been ok if only I had returned now and been able to cancel my order, but I&#8217;ve already recieved the mail for dispatch&#8230;..</p>

      <div class="author_meta">23 Jul 2006</div>

          <p>From &#8220;How To Succeed With Women Without Really Trying&#8221; c1957</p>
<p>&#8220;The first wife, as opposed to the fiancee, must be practicable and serviceable. She is neither a toy, an ornament, nor a playmate. She will be your wife during the early, hard years before you can afford a staff of servants. She will serve as mother, cook, housemaid, chauffeur, nurse, and charwoman. This will allow her, if she is nimble, six or seven hours of sleep a night, ample for a sturdy girl.</p>
<p>It is best, before deciding definitely, to test for firmness. Few of us would consider buying a grapefruit before squeezing it-yet how many make the far more important choice of close companion in a sloppy, hit-or-miss fashion?</p>
<p>Using the thumb and forefinger, exert gentle pressure along certain key muscles. A girl with good muscular tone will wear well and last for years, even if neglected occasionally. She will not tire easily, and will usually maintain a cheerful disposition despite long hours and hard work.</p>
<p>&#8216;Davie, you pinched me!&#8217;<br>&#8216;Oh, sorry, Pheobe. Must have slipped.&#8217;<br>&#8216;Well stop!&#8217;<br>&#8216;Have you ever thought of taking a bit more exercise?&#8217; &#8220;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Jul 2006</div>

          <p>So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).</p>
<p>Then theres that other little thing, of my engagement to Viv, which is extremely exciting. We snuck off together to climb the hill during the afternoon and returned engaged seeing if anyone would notice the ring upon Vivs finger. Oh the children we are. She&#8217;d kind of seen it coming, but was still a little taken aback that it was happening for real I think. While I don&#8217;t know what the future holds for either of us, I do know that I want to spend it together.  </p>
