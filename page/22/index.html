        I went back home this weekend for Tim and Becca&#8217;s wedding. Although the weather didn&#8217;t hold out &#8211; it was raining all day, the guys made the most of it and the service was fab. Music was provided by Mr Maynard and a string quartet. By far the most amusing thing was the pastor&#8217;s inability to use a radio mike without whispering the whole service. So amusing sentences like &#8220;Don&#8217;t fall down the steps&#8230;.

        I went to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night &#8211; which I thought was great, compared to the original preconceptions I had of it from trailers, reviews and the like. Anyways, I was sat there at the end as all the children were walking out of the factory thinking, &#8220;Well, at least I&#8217;m not as thin as Mike TV&#8221;.

        So, after renewing my insurance policy today, I get handed the piece of paper with my policy number and the words &#8220;Ashley, love&#8221;. I&#8217;m unsure whether the guy wrote this in awe of myself or indeed it had been written previously on the pad in use. Either way, the words in that order don&#8217;t make any sense. Dyslexia perhaps? There&#8217;s been a bit of talk and reading recently involving dating with integrity, not settling with second best and the like, but this ranks a few rungs below that upon my ladder unfortunately.

        On a lighter note, I went to a &#8216;focus group&#8217; last night which was fairly surreal. I&#8217;d been asked last week to attend, and had agreed not actually knowing the subject matter. On sunday I was informed that it was going to be on &#8216;mens cosmetics&#8217; (something I&#8217;m obviously very familiar with!) so didn&#8217;t really know what to expect. After arriving, discovering two of my old coursemates were there (and on the same course as Garima), we sat down for like 45 minutes talking about our opinions about luxuries, cosmetics and as many tangents we could stray off on as possible.

        I&#8217;ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I&#8217;d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it&#8217;s quite the opposite really.
My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it&#8217;s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase.

        So, in the absence of students, life continues as normal for the various research teams down here in the Queens buildings. We wake, march to University and sit in our little boxes reading, theorising and tearing our hair out until 5 o&#8217;clock when we march back, only to be repeated the next day. I hate routines&#8230;
Today marked the graduation of Year 3&#8242;s which brought back memories of my graduation last year, which was pretty depressing to be honest.

        It&#8217;s been a good week thus far. Saturday marked a return to Somerset to attend Steve and Hannah&#8217;s wedding, which I was a little late for due to having to pick up a number of interesting things I&#8217;ve been given by Gran. I felt a little harsh having to dash in, collect and leave, it felt a little like Dad and I were looting the place.
Being late was ok as one of the speakers was following in just after me (apparently a bit of a search was going on for him prior to the service), confirming we were good to creep through the large arched doors as the sound of singing could be heard.

        Today I travelled on 2 planes, 3 buses and 1 car (thats a full house and extra) to make the 800 mile round trip to Edinburgh for part of a BioDiveristyWorld conference. I&#8217;m quite surprised I managed to organise and sort out everything since Monday and it go according to plan.
I was actually really overwhelmed at how amazing the place was for the brief time I was there, the sheer scale of the city was something else.

        I forgot to write a classic quote I found in &#8216;Boy&#8217; while I was away so I thought I&#8217;d shove it up now. I think it encompasses how I feel about work at the moment. Really enjoyed just lazing about reading in France for ages, finished Pi, although I found it to drag on somewhat, the quirky bit at the end made it fairly clever. Onto some Pratchett now after resisiting for ages.

        Our last day in Jard was rather less exciting than we&#8217;d hoped, we decided to clean the place* we were staying in, so spent the morning doing that and unfortunately the weather was cack so didn&#8217;t make for much of an afternoon either. We apparently caught the back end of a heatwave this week which has been rather fortunate, although pretty uncomfortable in the evenings. (Tim had it worse being in the same room as Mr &#8216;Exorcist&#8217; Pete, I had to endure that in Germany so it&#8217;s his turn this time).
