        So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of iTunes, the ROKR E1 &#8211; a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the iPod nano &#8211; a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod &#8211; how many have there been now? There&#8217;s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3&#8242;s just yet &#8211; except my portable fat hard drive.

        These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj&#8217;ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe&#8217;s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I&#8217;m a bit out of practice.
Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band &#8220;Walking Wounded&#8221; all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support).

        I&#8217;ve been having some really random dreams this week, the strangest part being I can actually remember them. Here&#8217;s a few examples:
Sunday &#8211; I had one of those ones where, you&#8217;re aware you&#8217;re asleep and can control whats going on, but was face down on my bed and completely overcome by something and unable to move any part of my body. When I woke up, with a bit of a start, I&#8217;d only been out for a half hour.

        I was inspired yesterday by watching a few vids on the internet of crazy kids doing trials unicycling, so decided to go out for a ride in the evening round Roath Park. It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve ridden, but it seems you don&#8217;t forget. Nor do the &#8216;oh I&#8217;m original&#8217; taunts cease, such as &#8220;oi, mate, you&#8217;ve lost a wheel!&#8221;, &#8220;pull a wheelie!&#8221; etc etc. Anyway, it was nice to finally ride mine without fear of the horrid scratching which I usually obtain from my previous saddle.

        I went back home this weekend for Tim and Becca&#8217;s wedding. Although the weather didn&#8217;t hold out &#8211; it was raining all day, the guys made the most of it and the service was fab. Music was provided by Mr Maynard and a string quartet. By far the most amusing thing was the pastor&#8217;s inability to use a radio mike without whispering the whole service. So amusing sentences like &#8220;Don&#8217;t fall down the steps&#8230;.

        I went to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night &#8211; which I thought was great, compared to the original preconceptions I had of it from trailers, reviews and the like. Anyways, I was sat there at the end as all the children were walking out of the factory thinking, &#8220;Well, at least I&#8217;m not as thin as Mike TV&#8221;.

        So, after renewing my insurance policy today, I get handed the piece of paper with my policy number and the words &#8220;Ashley, love&#8221;. I&#8217;m unsure whether the guy wrote this in awe of myself or indeed it had been written previously on the pad in use. Either way, the words in that order don&#8217;t make any sense. Dyslexia perhaps? There&#8217;s been a bit of talk and reading recently involving dating with integrity, not settling with second best and the like, but this ranks a few rungs below that upon my ladder unfortunately.

        On a lighter note, I went to a &#8216;focus group&#8217; last night which was fairly surreal. I&#8217;d been asked last week to attend, and had agreed not actually knowing the subject matter. On sunday I was informed that it was going to be on &#8216;mens cosmetics&#8217; (something I&#8217;m obviously very familiar with!) so didn&#8217;t really know what to expect. After arriving, discovering two of my old coursemates were there (and on the same course as Garima), we sat down for like 45 minutes talking about our opinions about luxuries, cosmetics and as many tangents we could stray off on as possible.

        I&#8217;ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I&#8217;d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it&#8217;s quite the opposite really.
My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it&#8217;s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase.

        So, in the absence of students, life continues as normal for the various research teams down here in the Queens buildings. We wake, march to University and sit in our little boxes reading, theorising and tearing our hair out until 5 o&#8217;clock when we march back, only to be repeated the next day. I hate routines&#8230;
Today marked the graduation of Year 3&#8242;s which brought back memories of my graduation last year, which was pretty depressing to be honest.
