        That last post aside heres a mildly amusing anecdote that happened to me whilst in B�Q a couple of weeks ago featuring a sweet old welsh lady.
Old Lady (Looking at lampshades): “Is that the ACTUAL price of these!?”
Me (Bewildered, wondering past end of aisle): “Well, yeah, it says so on the label”
Old Lady: “£11.99! I saw ‘em for £1 on Newport Road!”
Me (Still bewildered, now in aisle): “Oh.

        I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don’t think is interesting at all, but I’ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others.

        Some of you may have noticed that I’ve moved. Whats that? You didn’t? Oh well, cheers then, how much of a friend are you? I never read your blog either. For those who didn’t – take a look in the address bar, I’m now at www.ianwootten.co.uk (Highly original I know!).
This week I have been mostly stressing about work, sitting at home alone, watching repeats, finding interesting links through the wonder of del.

        So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of iTunes, the ROKR E1 – a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the iPod nano – a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod – how many have there been now? There’s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3′s just yet – except my portable fat hard drive.

        These last couple of weeks have been fairly exciting from a musical point of view. I dj’ed for both Sarah Lou and Zoe’s birthday parties, which were both fantabulous, getting to hang with new and making even newer friends. My mixing on each was somewhat dodgy, but to be honest I’m a bit out of practice.
Tim had been preparing for his CD launch for his band “Walking Wounded” all week last week, and their performance upon Thursday at Journeys showed off all their hard work (although unfortunately, I don’t think the same can be said of the random geezer who decided to perform last minute inbetween them and the support).

        I’ve been having some really random dreams this week, the strangest part being I can actually remember them. Here’s a few examples:
Sunday – I had one of those ones where, you’re aware you’re asleep and can control whats going on, but was face down on my bed and completely overcome by something and unable to move any part of my body. When I woke up, with a bit of a start, I’d only been out for a half hour.

        I was inspired yesterday by watching a few vids on the internet of crazy kids doing trials unicycling, so decided to go out for a ride in the evening round Roath Park. It’s been a long time since I’ve ridden, but it seems you don’t forget. Nor do the ‘oh I’m original’ taunts cease, such as “oi, mate, you’ve lost a wheel!”, “pull a wheelie!” etc etc. Anyway, it was nice to finally ride mine without fear of the horrid scratching which I usually obtain from my previous saddle.

        I went back home this weekend for Tim and Becca’s wedding. Although the weather didn’t hold out – it was raining all day, the guys made the most of it and the service was fab. Music was provided by Mr Maynard and a string quartet. By far the most amusing thing was the pastor’s inability to use a radio mike without whispering the whole service. So amusing sentences like “Don’t fall down the steps….

        I went to watch Charlie and the Chocolate factory last night – which I thought was great, compared to the original preconceptions I had of it from trailers, reviews and the like. Anyways, I was sat there at the end as all the children were walking out of the factory thinking, “Well, at least I’m not as thin as Mike TV”.

        So, after renewing my insurance policy today, I get handed the piece of paper with my policy number and the words “Ashley, love”. I’m unsure whether the guy wrote this in awe of myself or indeed it had been written previously on the pad in use. Either way, the words in that order don’t make any sense. Dyslexia perhaps? There’s been a bit of talk and reading recently involving dating with integrity, not settling with second best and the like, but this ranks a few rungs below that upon my ladder unfortunately.
