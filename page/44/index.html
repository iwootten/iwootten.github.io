          <p>Today we went over to the salt marshes in Olonne, it being slightly more manageable weather and all. Tim basically wanted to do a little birdwatching and Heledd and Dave didn&#8217;t fancy such french beauty so went to have coffee in a suitable village somewhere. It was really cool, took lots of photos of the strange green murky waters and had a bunch of exercise too. Saw loads of eels while we were there &#8211; horrible things writhing about&#8230;.</p>
<p>Lunch heralded more wine &#8211; sweet aperitif&#8217;s before and more red during. I&#8217;m thinking the rest of the week will hold lots more judging from wine connisieur Dave.. Enlightened myself by making lots of names from pomme frites.</p>
<p>On to another book &#8216;Life of Pi&#8217; by Yann Martel. Bit weird so far.</p>

          <p>Sunday&#8217;s morning events weren&#8217;t overly exciting &#8211; the weather has been so hot that it would be a bit much to go off and try to do anything. Instead has been a morning of reading (Dahl&#8217;s &#8216;Boy&#8217; &#8211; bizzarrely featuring Cardiff, La Rochelle and Somerset within) and people trying to juggle. The afternoon became overcast so we decided to make the trip down to the beach, where Tim, Rach and Pete all got rather dirty trying to recreate a eurotunnel experience, which was destroyed as soon as it was completed by Dave. </p>
<p>People have done a great job of selecting french foods, we&#8217;ve had all manner of bread, cheeses and hams while we&#8217;ve been here so far and a shedload of wine to boot.</p>

          <p>So, it begins, the holiday season that is and with it my two day trip across England and back down the west coast of France to Jard Su Mer. Todays trip was fairly long, spending two hours bombing down the M4 to meet with the guys in Reading, then a further few to reach the underside of London on the M25, and a bit more to finally bundle over toward the Eurotunnel. The best part was discovery that Pete has finally grown a full-on beard, after years spend with us and 3 inch stubble. Dave, ever being the technophile has brought a couple of CB&#8217;s with us so that our car&#8217;s can communicate with one another whilst on the road.</p>
<p>After a bit of a confusing time on entry to the eurotunnel, figuring out where exactly we were meant to be, with tons of gates to pass through and a distinct lack of passport checking, we spent the 30 minute trip and viola we&#8217;re in France. Driving down the top floor of a train has got to be one of the most surreal experiences I&#8217;ve had for a while, reminded me of rebel&#8217;s attack on the deathstar. You might be able to see what I mean from the photo&#8217;s. Hotel was good &#8211; a short trip from the chunnels exit, and out on its own in the middle of nowhere. The hotel decided I must be Dave&#8217;s wife. Nice pics of french sunset.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the second day of travelling was rather less exciting, except for the prospect of arrival at our final destination. On anticipatition of the 450 miles that we were to travel today, it was elected that we set of early at 10 and try and cover as much distance as possible. Little were we to know what today would involve &#8211; and after a few refills of tanks of fuel (another bizzarre experience, just fill up and keep going &#8211; I&#8217;ve never had to travel anywhere further that involved more than a tank), payment for numerous motorway use, stopping off for lunch (speaking french to french person for the first time), discovery that CB communication is crap within moving vehicles, loosing the other car and then finding it again in a super-u and starting and finishing Roald Dahl&#8217;s &#8216;Ah Sweet Mystery of Life&#8217; we finally arrived at about 9pm. Sleep is definitely on the agenda now..</p>

          <p>You&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that the title might refer to Pop&#8217;s funeral this week, but no, I mean the fact that finally after 7 years in courtship Mike and Jo have become hitched. Thats strike 5 from the core Yeovil lad&#8217;s posse&#8230;</p>
<p>It was a fab day, with schoolfriends from yesteryear I haven&#8217;t kept up to date with, and family members I never knew existed. My sister always seems to find it amusing that Jo&#8217;s sis, Sarah got hitched before them being a couple of years younger, having her been to school with Sarah and Jo in my form.</p>
<p>I found it amusing that I was shunned to a back-row-corner seat due to not fitting in with a 2 pair seating plan, basically because I&#8217;m not hooked up yet (er, in the partner sense). I suppose I should get used to that for the summer. Other amusing events included the eyebrow/moustache mix-up, confetti games and guess the wannabe bride.</p>

    The funeral was also (obviously) quite emotional, with numerous family members who I never knew existed until the day before. Gran managed to hold it together extremely well, even joking about before that she was wearing navy, because black &#8216;reminds me of funerals&#8217;&#8230;..
  </p>

  <p>
    I found out as well that my cousin who lives down the bay has been using my gym membership&#8230;which is fair enough &#8211; I&#8217;ve been once since I joined. It was good to see family even if it was under unfortunate circumstances.

          <p>No, not the monthly breaks event in Clwb Ifor, though you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that&#8217;s what this post would be about due to regular raving about it, no, <em>actual </em>Sumo.</p>
<p>So I started my trip off at 9:45am &#8211; realising that actually that Tesco&#8217;s would be shut if I left earlier and I&#8217;d not get fuel.. After faffing getting burgers and the like, I set off about 10:20am to Bournemouth. I hadn&#8217;t anticipated how long the journey would take, my not knowing the route and all. I arrived about 1:00pm and after making wrong turn after wrong turn finally found myself really close to the guys, but on the wrong side of the estuary&#8230;oops</p>
<p>After getting on the ferry (exciting!) and spying the suits on shell bay, I trundled down the beach to meet up with all the guys (2:00pm) who&#8217;d been down in Bournemouth since friday. Then the fun began, we held a bunch of Sumo tournaments wearing huge yellow padded suits which was great on my first round, beating some guy I&#8217;d never met before, with relative ease (!) the next round was a little different, being pitted against Adam, Mikes bro who is a Marine&#8230;suffice to say I lost that. Due to the way our tournament worked we had to find our &#8220;Ultimate Loser&#8221; as well, so next I had to wrestle mikes sis, Libby, which was amusing, being able to win with a couple of sidesteps.</p>
<p>The guys, always wanting to get the most for their money then spent the rest of the time making up amusing Sumo games. Sumo racing, Sumo Totem poles, Sumo Tunneling to name a few. It was an amazing laugh, even when the gazebo flipped up chucking our industrial size bar-b and its contents tumbling to the beach and setting stuff on fire. I&#8217;ll get some pics up on here asap.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t all fun and games though, Steve managed to stuff his back up (by performing a forward roll of all things) and had to be driven back to Swindon by Gav because he wasn&#8217;t up to it. It&#8217;s not serious, but he was in A &#038; E till 3am trying to get it x-rayed and stuff to check it out.</p>
<p>Anyways, I&#8217;m down here in the South until Tuesday, sticking around until Pops funeral is over. I spent a large chunk of time going through my Dads family tree&#8230;with mum( <img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> ) to clue me up on everyone I haven&#8217;t seen in ages&#8230;.my Dads the youngest of 6, all of which have their own families so its mighty, mighty confusing (especially as my Mum is 1 of 4 as well)&#8230;. I need to make a family tree I think.  </p>
