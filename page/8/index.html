        Just a quick note to remind people that this coming week is the third Cardiff meetup for web types in wales. It&#8217;s in 10 Feet Tall on Church St on Wednesday 4th June from 6.30pm. Featured speakers include Matthew Cashmore (Development Producer for BBC Future Media &#038; Technology, Research and Innovation) and Tim Holmes (Course co-ordinator for the Postgraduate Diploma in Magazine Journalism and the MA International Journalism: Magazine Pathway at Cardiff University&#8217;s School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies).

        I&#8217;m not sure how many visitors have caught this ted talk before, but I&#8217;d thought I&#8217;d post it anyway. Johnny Chung Lee is amazing, turning a $40 wii remote into use an interactive whiteboard or a new way to interact with video games via head tracking. He&#8217;s been at this sort of thing for ages previously putting out a $14 steadycam.

        Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I&#8217;m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with fairdos and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don&#8217;t appeal to us at all.

        One of the things that&#8217;s bugged me for a while whilst having a website is that at certain times of the year when people might actually like to buy me a gift they&#8217;re unable to find my wishlist. This is mainly because they&#8217;re simple folk who might not think to check amazon for my name. I&#8217;m also signed up with amazon associates, so I decided it could do me well to post my wishlist items along with my referral tag in the links in order to earn a bob or two on my own homepage.

        In this book, author David Upton walks you through use of the Code Igniter framework, which is essentially PHP&#8217;s answer to Ruby on Rails. I&#8217;ve been a avid user of Code Igniter since I discovered it last year, which is a nice waypoint for anyone trying to understand model-view-controller architectures and not wanting to make the move over to ROR quite yet.
The angle of this book is taken from a first time CI developer, but one with some knowledge of both PHP and web development in general.

        One of the most frustrating things I find about hearing about possible web development jobs on certain sites is the sheer amount of them which are simply unviable due to my UK location. Previously I decided to post all those jobs I could find to my own webtyrant site and the recent job and profile sites in the django communities has got me thinking about how these two pieces of information on locality could be aggregated together (I don&#8217;t have time myself to do this though unfortunately &#8211; perhaps someone might like to chat about collaborating).

        Learning jQuery takes a look at the JavaScript library jQuery by Jonathan Chaffer and Karl Swedberg, whom run learningjquery.com, a popular resource to jQuery developers. Jonathan and Karl work through a example based approach of common problems in web application development to demonstrate how jQuery can be used to minimize the amount of code written by developers and instead focus on the functionality of their code. The book is set for the developer with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript but a jQuery novice.

        One of the most frustrating things I find in managing a number of websites is that I&#8217;m always forgetting passwords. The version of Filezilla I&#8217;m running however makes it easy to remember them again through its use of weak XOR encryption and a the key being hard coded into the software. I&#8217;ve used a program previously called the Filezilla Password Recover, but it turns out that this is also extremely easy to extract them using a simple PHP script.

        I&#8217;m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I&#8217;ll be rewarded. It&#8217;s a tag line I adopted for the small hosting company that I&#8217;ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn&#8217;t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done &#8211; even if it does mean a longer struggle through.
