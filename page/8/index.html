<p>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my “business” cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing “beta” on hand hand-made ones or something…</p>

<p>Yes, yes I know I already posted about the <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/08/08/fowa-roadtrip-bristol/">FOWA Roadtrip in Bristol</a>, but I live in Cardiff and have friends and <a href="http://www.gr0w.com">colleagues in Bristol too</a>. I promise I didn&#8217;t just head there for free drinks once again. This time the <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems team</a> had pulled together some funky little <a href="http://www.futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip/">FOWA Roadtrip</a> badges that they handed out on the door, rather than the stickers at Bristol. I&#8217;d previously learned that Ryan&#8217;s wife, Gillian had taken a MSc in Cardiff and it seems the same is true of <a href="http://carsonsystems.com/about.html">Lisa Price</a> too. I had a really interesting conversation with Lisa about how Future Publishing (whom she previously worked for) produced one of my favourite mags (PCFormat) back in my adolescence. (I actually still own all the magazines I bought for like 3 years and harbour plans to ship them back to Future in Bath, along with all the CDs).</p>
<p>Anyway, it was grand that those who were involved in the web app scene in Cardiff finally made it to an event together, and our newly formed <a href="http://cardiffgeeks.net">Cardiff Geeks</a> group is already scheming to stage another meet up for geeky people. (It&#8217;s a good label, it&#8217;s a nerd you don&#8217;t want to be).</p>

<div class="author_meta">08 Sep 2007</div>
<p>Since moving to Taffs Well, just outside of Cardiff, Viv and I have enjoyed fantastic views of the Garth. This mountain is the centre for the original true story of “The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down A Mountain”, a book/film which I managed to catch on TV this week. Basically, it goes like this, the villagers of Taffs Well work together to try to prevent an English cartographer from leaving the village and classifying the Garth as a hill. They gradually take soil to the top of the (then) hill and eventually get it classed as a mountain by the cartographer. Carrying all that soil is no easy feat – it does require roping in all the villagers into getting it up the hill. It was quite amusing to be sitting in our living room watching a film about the mountain which could be seen through the window right next to our television. Anyway I’m really enjoying it out here – its such a sight to wake up every morning and see the Garth covered in cloud at its peak. I hope Viv and I get the chance and enough enthusiasm to walk it together soon. <a href="http://blog.stuartherbert.com/">Stuart Herbert</a> has some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartherbert/tags/thegarth/">great pics of the Garth on flickr</a>.</p>

<div class="author_meta">07 Sep 2007</div>
<p>I’ve long wondered why there doesn’t seem to be much happening in terms of community of the web professionals in wales. There is a vibrant collection of people sporting different skill sets in the area, yet as I can see not a lot of chat amongst everyone in between different groups. On a whim, I decided to create a facebook group “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5399328503">Cardiff Web Geeks</a>” to try and get people to come out of their shells and actually participate in a bit of discussion about tech topics in wales. I’ve invited a bunch of people who might be interested and hopefully we’ll be able to organise some sort of chats and discussions at meetups, rather than having to cross the border back to England and sponge from our friends over there. (Each one of those return trips costs…) If you are interested in what’s going on with people and the web in Wales, I’d invite you to sign up and participate in what hopefully could be built into a nice valuable community in our local area. </p>

<p>[Update - We now have our own <a href="http://cardiffgeeks.net">website</a>! Rock on!]</p>

<div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2007</div>
<p>Wow, Apple have released a new touch version of the iPod (think the iPhone with no phone) as well as updating the classic iPod (160Gb!) and new nano versions. This actually means I&#8217;d be able to have an iPod which fits my entire music collection upon it with room to spare. I&#8217;ve waited a long time for that. The iPod touch also allows wireless browsing and download of new music via iTunes. Nano versions now rock up in both 4Gb standard and 8Gb models. I&#8217;m sure someone in our department will have one before long&#8230;.</p>

<div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2007</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/would_you_share_your_search_history.php">couple</a> of <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-facebook-app.html">rumours</a> this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&#8217;s some discussion over on <a href="http://facereviews.com/2007/08/28/google-facebook-application-a-hoax/">facereviews.com</a> that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &#8220;social networks&#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for? Probably not at all &#8211; I don&#8217;t want everyone to be clued in to all those random tee sites I&#8217;m able to find. Probably nobody would really be interested, so whats the point anyway?</p>

<p>It also brings to mind an idea that I&#8217;ve been toying with for sharing how links between pages are made, where details of hyperlink clicks are captured to some repository somewhere. This would make it it possible for users to have a series of heatmaps upon any page to display details of common links that other users choose to follow from one page to another, and common routes accross the net to particular pages. Similar issues for whether or not takeup would occur, or the information is indeed useful to everyone exist also.</p>

<p>The other evening I managed to stretch my back awkwardly and I’ve been feeling the repercussions of it ever since. It’s extremely painful to move my head, arm or neck and I’m getting really frustrated by not being able to sit at the computer without being uncomfortable. Wednesday night I was flat out in bed not able to move an inch, and little more of an improvement last night. It’s making me really tired and irritable. Grr!</p>

<div class="author_meta">08 Aug 2007</div>
<p>Yesterday evening I had the pleasure of meeting up with a bunch of fellow geeks and web peeps over in Bristol as part of <a href="http://carsonified.com">Ryan Carsons</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com">Future of Web Applications</a> <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/raodtrip">Roadtrip</a>. </p>
<p>It was a bit of a crazy evening, with me stuck in Cardiff for the best part of two hours prior to leaving. This was due to a &#8220;large fire&#8221; in Newport which was smoking out the rail line so the fire brigade shut everything down. Luckily, at about 6.30pm the line opened up again and I made it over to Bristol. I&#8217;d met up with Evan Rudowski and Jo(?) of <a href="http://www.subhub.com">SubHub</a> prior at Cardiff station and therefore headed over with them.</p>
<p>It was a good evening, with me able to catch up with <a href="http://jontangerine.com">Jon</a> and <a href="http://dotjay.co.uk">Jon</a> of the <a href="http://gr0w.com">Grow Collective</a> (with whom I shall hopefully be working with very soon, but more on that later). I don&#8217;t think I ever used the free drink I was entitled too with my lovely check sticker Ryan graced me with. A similar event is happening in Cardiff on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.com/roadtrip">10th September over in the bay</a>, if you&#8217;re a web type in wales you&#8217;d probably do well to check it out.</p>
<p>Update: there&#8217;s more info on the event on <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/08/08/thanks-bristol/">Future of Web Apps blog</a>. I even made it into a couple of photos, albeit adorning a rucksack. The fire in Newport <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/6936270.stm">completely destroyed a row of houses</a>. I guess I didn&#8217;t have it that bad&#8230;</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/07/22/my-stag-do">My Stag Do</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">22 Jul 2007</div>
<p>Now that the big day has passed, I thought I’d start revealing how some of my days in the lead up to it were spent. For my stag do, firstly we had a fairly quiet night in playing computer games, after doing a shop at Asda and getting the majority of mates locked out of our new pad. Many laughed at my wii fighting skills. Saturday, we travelled over to the Forest of Dean to climb through the tree-course that is <a href="http://www.goape.co.uk/">Go Ape</a>. This was really great fun and definitely a little different than some of the other stag do’s I’ve been on. Basically, you attach yourself to a steel rope and move through a bunch of trees high up, except the route taken might not be as straight forward as a bridge. Give it a try, it defintely was worth the money… I also highly recommend watching the videos below for an idea of the action.</p>

<p>On the saturday afternoon, we travelled to er, somewhere to have a go at shooting some stuff. Don’t worry, it wasn’t ever alive. Well, you obviously need to know how to operate a 12 gauge before you get married, surely? The chap guiding us was a Lord and seemed rather keen on letting us all know about it, also how Nelson Mandela was a terrorist and he’d put him away, nice….</p>

<p>Anyway following an evening on the town due to being kicked out of our new pad for the girls to take over, Sunday we met up with the hen do to have a fairly surprisingly decent day at the beach (people even burnt!). Some people decided to bury me in rocks…but Viv rescued me. As people decided to head off, I was quite chuffed I’d got away without anything dodgy going down.</p>
