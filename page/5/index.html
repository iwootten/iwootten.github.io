        All my most recent blog posts seem to be about updating my blog tooling (much as Rick commented earlier today). By recent, I obviously mean within the last 5 years.
I back tracked through my blog updates and discovered I&rsquo;ve used 5 different tools over my 15 year history on the web.
 Moveable Type (2003) b2/Cafelog (2003) WordPress (2003) Jekyll (2014) Metalsmith (2015) Hugo (2018)  Something got lost in the process of migrating through all these blogging platforms, using increasingly complex plugins to generate what is simple static html.

        As part of my past work with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I worked with the survey runner team to add additional features to their Electronic Questionnaire which enabled the business to take regular surveys electronically via the web. During my final months there, I took it upon myself to tackle what was seen to be one of the projects major pieces of technical debt, its use of a custom form renderer.

        As a freelancer who has worked with clients using non disclosure agreements in the past, it&rsquo;s often difficult to showcase or build a portfolio of my work. I&rsquo;m not alone on this, I know. Sarah Parmenter for one has posted about this problem as a designer.
As a developer, I sometimes feel it&rsquo;s impossible to easily show a concise representation of my work in a public arena anyway. How can I convey my role in what will usually be a complex process involving many other parties?

        I&rsquo;m switching blogging platforms once more. Moving from Wordpress to Jekyll enabled me to no longer deal with the multitude of updates and protected me hacks I could be susceptible to, but Jekyll being written in Ruby (a language I&rsquo;m not overly familiar with) has been a problem. I&rsquo;ve been able to cobble together scripts to deal with the custom parts of my blog build, but it&rsquo;s never felt like home.

        I recently discovered the library OpenImageIO, an awesome tool for reading and writing image files. What makes this of particular interest is the sheer variety of image files supported (BMP, Cineon, JPG, JPG-2000, GIF, DPX, OpenEXR, Targa, TIFF) (as well as variety of camera raw formats) and the fact it can perform image transformations upon them very easily. Given it&rsquo;s designed for use in media and VFX environments it sounds like it will be useful for the type of work I&rsquo;ve previously been involved with in stop motion.

        Recently, Andy Davies asked the following question on twitter: Any ideas on how I can easily convert a video to a filmstrip?
&mdash; Andy Davies (@AndyDavies) July 23, 2014  I found this pretty interesting, especially given I&rsquo;d used various open source tools for assembling storyboards in the past. I knew it was possible to extract images at desired intervals and left it as that.
After a bit of digging last night, I discovered it&rsquo;s actually possible to extract images based on changes in the video.

        Dates are one of those annoying things that shouldn&rsquo;t be, but are regularly difficult in web apps. I used the following two methods in a recent page to neatly break a date range into distinct segments as part of a analytics app I&rsquo;m currently working on. Hopefully someone else will find them helpful.
import datetime, calendar # Find the delta between two dates based on a desired number of ranges def datedelta(startdate, enddate, no_of_ranges): start_epoch = calendar.

        Having heard the question raised on @workingoutshow, I thought I&rsquo;d take some time to share the things that I&rsquo;ve found have really helped me be productive in my work. These may not work for everyone, but hopefully some points will help for others.
Find a Good Environment The single biggest change I&rsquo;ve found which has had a major impact on my work is changing my environment. We&rsquo;re lucky enough to have a small garden at our house and with the arrival of my daughter back in October, I was quick to realise that working in the open plan lounge in our house just wasn&rsquo;t a viable option any more.

        In the second of my posts in porting a wordpress blog over to jekyll, I outline how I&rsquo;ve replicated wordpress&rsquo;s default permalink structure on my own blog.
Creating Category and Tag Pages Jekyll doesn&rsquo;t create category or tag index pages for those categories listed in your _posts source. Instead, you&rsquo;ll need to use a plugin to recreate them. I used the tutorial here as the basis for my category/tag generator, with my plugins/generate_cats_and_tags.

        As my last post indicated, I recently made the decision to leave wordpress for jekyll for my blogging software of choice. There were a number of hurdles I had to overcome in order to get to a state I was happy with, emulating my previous blog structure. This first post details a few of the setup problems and how I&rsquo;ve overcome them.
Using Compass for a Jekyll theme The first problem I hit was my use of compass to create parts of the theme I intended to use for my blog.
