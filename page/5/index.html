        Unless you&#8217;ve been living under a rock, you&#8217;ll realise that there&#8217;s an uprising against paypal amongst developers. Most of this stems from the multitude of crazy requirements they put upon sellers and the locks they can put upon your account without notice.
This in part has led to a number of payment alternatives cropping up. Here in the UK for instance, you have Google checkout and checkout by Amazon pitching up against paypal.

        Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for New Adventures 2012. I&#8217;d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand.
I&#8217;ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn&#8217;t miss a thing.

        I just sent the following email to 1 &#038; 1&#8242;s billing department. I&#8217;ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.
As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.

        I&#8217;ve been working on some fun little node.js / couchdb projects of late. Given the fact I don&#8217;t use either as part of my work, I&#8217;ve spent some downtime experimenting and slowly iterating my approaches as I learn best practice.
I hit what I consider to be a fairly frustrating hurdle that couchdb threw up that I&#8217;ve been blissfully unaware of through all my couchdb dev. When it came to doing pagination it turns out I&#8217;ve always been doing it the &#8220;bad&#8221; way.

        Octopress is a framework for blogging based on the static site generator jekyll. In short jekyll takes markdown and turns it into blog style html ready to be served straight away with Apache whilst Octopress dresses it up nicely with HTML5, responsive layout goodness and gives you a bunch of options for code formatting and the like. A perfect little blogging setup for hackers for those of us who typically won&#8217;t need all the bells and whistles on our blog I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree.

        Just a quick note to say I&#8217;ve updated the plugin that generates my filmstream pages. It&#8217;s become obvious that the Lovefilm API only exposes the last 10 features that you&#8217;ve rented in their &#8220;at home&#8221; list. This isn&#8217;t that great if you&#8217;ve been renting more than a few months. This is the same as the information you&#8217;d see in your account when logged in.
I&#8217;ve made a simple modification to use the actual ids that Lovefilm issue for films, rather than a autoincrement value.

        Last week, tickets went on sale for dConstruct 2011 and sold out within an impressive 7 hours. Having attended in 2010 and 2008 and judging it to be filled with the highest calibre web celebs from across the globe, I coughed up the entrance fee as part of the excited gold-rush. The cost of £150 includes access to the pre and after parties and the conference itself.
These type of events are stuffed to the brim with amazing, intelligent web professionals, many of whom I would consider to be colleagues.

        I hit a frustrating problem when trying to use expressjs alongside socket.io recently. The solution may seem somewhat trivial, but I struggled with it for a while, until finally asking for help on the socket.io irc channel. I&#8217;m not sure if a better solution exists for my case, but this is what I have for now.
In the main route of my express app, I needed to iterate across an array, performing a REST call using each element as a parameter and spit the results back for socket.

        Heres a quick how to on getting wordpress to update over SFTP. On a default install of php, wordpress only gives the option to update over FTP. I wanted to get it working as it&#8217;s more secure and means I don&#8217;t have to open up FTP on my virtual server and open another port up in the firewall.
I&#8217;m using ubuntu and the sequence of commands I followed were:
sudo apt-get install libssh2-1-dev libssh2-php  You should now find that if you list the modules installed in php and check if ssh2 is now there, you get the result &#8220;ssh2&#8243;:

        I listen to quite a few web dev podcasts. Something that irks me about a lot of them, is how much they tend to hype their own shows, products or the like. Sure, they&#8217;re allowed to, it is their own podcast after all, often from their own businesses etc. I&#8217;m fully aware this all possibly contributes toward the success of shows, but it annoys me nonetheless.
One of these things is the title of the show itself.
