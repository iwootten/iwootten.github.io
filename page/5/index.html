<div class="author_meta">15 Jun 2010</div>
<p>Here’s a heads up for anyone installing MPlayer on Snow Leopard. I’ve been playing a fair amount with tools recently and inevitably ending up running round in circles in installing, compiling, setting flags etc. Here’s a quick one liner param for anyone compiling mplayer (and freetype as its dependency) which people on Snow Leopard may find useful.</p>

<p>You’ll first need to download latest versions of <a href="http://www.freetype.org/download.html">freetype</a> and <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html">mplayer</a>. Uncompress both. &lt;div class="wp_syntax"&gt;</p>
<table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">cd</span> freetype
.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>configure
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span> <span style="color: #007800;">CXXFLAGS</span>=<span style="color: #ff0000;">"-m64"</span>
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">install</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>(Check here that the command “file /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.dylib” returns “Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64″) &lt;div class="wp_syntax"&gt;</p>
<table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">cd</span> mplayer-checkout-<span style="color: #000000;">2010</span>-06-<span style="color: #000000;">14</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">tar</span> <span style="color: #660033;">-xjvf</span> mplayer-checkout-snapshot.tar.bz2
.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>configure
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span>
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">make</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">install</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
<p>&lt;/div&gt;</p>

<p>The killer here for me was sudo make CXXFLAGS=”-m64″. Without it, mplayer’s make command failed with “ld: warning: in /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.dylib, file is not of required architecture”. I’ve encountered problems like this before, where the file is compiled for 32 Bit leopard rather than 64, but they’re usually solved with setting a CFLAGS variable.</p>

<div class="author_meta">18 Apr 2010</div>
<p>Something I’ve thought I’d like to have on my site for a while is a list of movies that I’ve recently seen and some brief opinions on them. I’m not entirely sure how I would go about this for films I see at the cinema, or whether I could muster the stamina to review every single film I’ve watched, but a recent television upgrade has now meant I’ve got the opportunity to do this.</p>

<p>Our television came with a years subscription to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">lovefilm</a>, which means I can now track our past film watching history. At four blu rays a month, that’s quite a lot of films over the course of the year.</p>

<p>Love Film have recently opened up their doors with an api and <a href="http://developer.lovefilm.com">developer area</a> (which unfortunately is not particularly active at the moment). Anyway – their documentation is pretty thorough and has made the process of creating a wordpress plugin to display my past rentals really simple. You can see some example output of it on my site <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/filmstream">over here</a>.</p>

<p>You can grab the plugin over <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/filmstream.zip">here</a>. It’s authenticated by oauth (for which you’ll require php on your blog host to be compiled with oauth enabled) and so will bounce you over to <a href="http://www.lovefilm.com">lovefilm</a> to ask for access to your account, but after that will update on a daily basis. Just click “Fetch Items” on the filmstream admin page and stick <code>&lt;!--filmstream_content--&gt;</code> in any page to display a table containing all your past rentals. There’s no options to speak of right now, but I’m sure I’ll be extending it in the future.</p>

<div class="author_meta">21 Mar 2010</div>
<p><a href="http://www.mixbooth.com">Mixbooth</a> is a dj mix hosting service I created several years ago. At the time there wasn’t a lot around in terms of options for allowing anyone to share them. You either had to exchange it upon a site filled with advertisements, or host it on your own space which might mean you’d breach your server bandwidth for any given month. I decided to use some space I had available at next to nothing to build something that might be of use to myself and any other dj whom saw fit to use it. It was good at the time and I got quite a buzz out of seeing new uploads appearing and hearing what others had created. I took the decision to end use of <a href="http://www.mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> after about a year of having a couple of mixes a week uploaded. This was mainly due to academic commitments at the time.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve been working on a rebuild of it for some time now. So I’m letting it loose on those who might be interested. I’m no longer hosting mixes, but hopefully exchanging useful info on them and those artists who feature within and allowing people to chat about them. It’s not everything I want it to be right now, but hopefully will serve to a use to djs other than myself. If you want to have a play, head to <a href="http://www.mixbooth.com/signup">www.mixbooth.com/signup</a> and I’ll get an invite out. I’ll also be tweeting updates via <a href="http://twitter.com/mixbooth">@mixbooth</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/2009/10/25/discovering-google">Discovering Google</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">25 Oct 2009</div>
<p>I’ve recently read a post over on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-40-history-arpanet">guardians technology site</a> which gave a whistle-stop history of the internet as it turns 40. I thought I’d share here my own experiences of growing up alongside the web, more for my own record than anything.</p>

<p>I remember at school a time at which there was no external connection, nor internal network (which we the pupils used) so the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Network_Computer">Acorn machines</a> used at our school at the time could communicate with one another. Computers, for me at that point were standalone. I had as much of an interest in computing then as I do now and I can remember early on, staying around after school to use one of the only PC’s in the school (which was bought to run a piece of career piece software called Kudos), in order to attempt to run the demo games from cds found on pc mags at the time (the only one I can remember was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104692/">lawnmower man</a> demo). I did this until ofter one time a friend and I accidentally removing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT">autoexec.bat</a> file which I hadn’t backed up…..oopsy</p>

<p><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/riscosoldlook-300x225.gif" alt="RiscOS. Old School. Literally. Taken from toastytech.com" title="riscosoldlook" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-350" /></p>

<p>I of course had to stick around at school because we didn’t have our own pc at home, because they were very, very expensive (When we did finally get one, it was a Crappard Bell 486 DX2 66, 4 MB of RAM, 400MB HD and was over £1000). I felt a little jealous of my friends who both had PC’s and were able to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta">Microsoft’s Encarta</a> to help them out with their homework at that time. (Interestingly Encarta later also became a <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/">website</a> and is to be discontinued later this week).</p>

<p>Bizarrely, I’d opted for A-Levels at 6th Form which didn’t allow me to experiment with pc’s much, not that it would have mattered as although the rest of the world was transitioning toward them, the <a href="http://www.gryphon.dorset.sch.uk/">Gryphon school</a> I attended had a whole computing lab full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiscPC">RiscPC</a>‘s. I think I went there once in the two years of A-Levels I did and kept my nose upturned whilst I was there.</p>

<p>Some point over this time, I’d also got hooked on a magazine called <a href="http://www.pcformat.co.uk/">PC Format</a> since the latter years of school, which allowed me to get all the games demos I wanted without spending however many years (and £’s) it would have taken to download them all. (I kept all 4 years worth of magazines I’d bought and cds/dvds right up unto moving in with my wife). At home, even though we were now in the year 1999, my parents hadn’t yet opted to purchase a dial-up modem and make that leap online. I was of course, still jealous of those mates – who now were connected. I got myself a hotmail account, where I eagerly awaited emails from no-one.</p>

<p>I can remember going to college and being scared about the prospect of doing a computing course but never having had any prior experience of using the web. My parents finally got a modem that year, but I still used to use the computing labs after teaching. I could download 1MB samples of music from <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk">Juno records</a> much more quickly over the leased line than I ever could waiting on the 56Kbps dialup at home. I also began working at <a href="http://www.dixons.co.uk/">Dixons</a> (for my sins), getting paid a pittance to talk to many clueless customers about “stereos”, “cd players” and “N64′s”. Working at Dixons did at least afford me the opportunity to experience playing Quake in Yeovils one and only internet cafe on a LAN against my friends and the staff that worked there. </p>

<p>My LAN parties moved to the computing labs at the university, outside of working hours (because as their 10 year old posters claim, you’re not allowed to use games on them during working hours…). Over several years of using the web, I’d never once heard of Google until it was mentioned by one of the research students taking our internet computing lectures. “You’ve probably heard of this” he said. “Er, no”, I thought – why did no-one tell me? I’d used a number of search engines such as <a href="http://www.lycos.co.uk/">lycos</a> and later <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">webcrawler</a>, but all were pretty awful in terms of giving me what I wanted – results. Instead they seemed content with a ridiculous number of adverts and making me hunt through a huge number of pages. Their pages now seem to indicate a new direction. </p>

<p>A bit of a trip down memory lane, but that’s how I ended up being introduced to Google. How about you?</p>

<div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2009</div>
<p>In order for me to generate this post I’ve created something quite novel on my blog – a new category which I’ve not had a great deal of experience in previously, “work”. For the last couple of months I’ve been working for <a href="http://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a> features in Bristol on their forthcoming feature film, “Pirates” – building software, which I’ll be doing at least for the next couple of months too.</p>

<p>I’ve been having an amazing experience over this time. Being landed in a fantastic position of working with extremely talented, creative individuals – whom have worked on tons of entertainment that I’ve chuckled away too throughout my life. I’ve been fortunate enough to have been sent to LA in order to read up and fully understand the software I’m working on too and also get to see many exciting elements of the production process. The nature of the work I’m doing has meant I’ve had to talk to everyone from the floor crew, model making, camera assistants and animators to visual effects and editorial. It has been a massive task to take in the huge amount of new information, but I am loving learning about every step in the process. It’s great to see all these steps under one roof working as a massive family unit.</p>

<p>The whole experience is to say the least exciting and quite honestly I am honoured to be involved with it! Here’s to the next couple of months….</p>

<p>PS: Check out some of <a href="http://www.aardman.com/aardman-characters/">aardmans wonderful characters on this page</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/2009/05/16/create-your-own-tinyurl-service-for-wordpress">Create Your Own TinyURL Service for WordPress</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 May 2009</div>
<p>I don’t particularly like using URL shortening services. I think I first noticed them getting used rather prolificly in the Guardians technology section to include lots of random links to bizarre web content. <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL’s own web site</a> wouldn’t particularly inspire me to go ahead and make use of it either. But, because of <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">my own use</a> of services such as twitter, I’m forced to shrink down links to get within those 144 characters.</p>

<p>Herein lies a problem – If said URL shortening service disappears, all my links are broken to all that interesting content I worked so hard to find. Not good.</p>

<p>In order to our bit to help, <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">a</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/?start=10">number</a> <a href="http://www.colly.com/comments/ee_shortener_plugin_your_own_short_urls_using_revcanonical_and_permanent_re/">of</a> <a href="http://bokardo.com/">developers</a> and even <a href="http://baconfile.com/">services</a> have taken action in order to make sure they provide alternatives for the links over which they’re responsible.</p>

<p>I’ve <a href="http://whomwah.com/2009/04/14/revcanonical-a-revcanonical-wordpress-plugin/">installed a plugin here</a> which uses the recently puchased domain “<a href="http://woot10.eu">woot10.eu</a>” to provide alternative links using the code <code>&lt;link rev="canonical" href="shorter link" /&gt;</code>. My full ianwootten.co.uk domain does not lend itself well to be able to provide a shorter URL on the same domain unforunately.</p>

<p>There is a whole huge discussion on the approriateness of using this technique (mainly) due to the rev attribute not being included in the HTML5 spec. See the comments in <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/save-the-internet-with-rev-canonical">Chris Shifletts post</a> for more on this.</p>

<p>Anyway, Duncans plugin takes the id of any wordpress post and coverts it to base 36 (instead of 10) and offers up the alternative in the header of each post. I believe the conversion could go all the way up to 62, if php’s base conversion actually supported the use of different cases in conversion.</p>

<p>In my own case, I’ve had to forward the links from woot10.eu across to www.ianwootten.co.uk using a .htaccess file so that the plugin is actually able to pick them up.</p>

<p>Now when you visit:</p>

<p><code>http://woot10.eu/p8p</code> you’ll be forwarded on to the longer URL such as <code>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/05/15/my-vicious-circle-of-posting-quality-content</code>.</p>

<p>This isn’t particularly useful if you want to find the alternative for URL, as you’ll have to hunt through the source of a post. For that I’d suggest <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">Simons bookmarklet</a> which looks for an alternative link, or creates one if it doesn’t exist using tinyurl. As an aside, there looks to be an interesting talk on the canonical attribute and link element by Matt Cutts of google <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm9onOGTgeM">here</a>.</p>

<h1><a href="/2009/05/15/my-vicious-circle-of-posting-quality-content">My Vicious Circle of Posting Quality Content</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">15 May 2009</div>
<p>I’ve been looking back at the posts on this site and the commitment that I supposedly made (internally) a couple of months ago about posting regular, interesting content. But it seemed to die a death very promptly.</p>

<p>I think that there may be a bit of a vicious circle here (in my own situation at least). I’d love to post regular interesting stuff, but for that to happen I need to feel that it might be read. By far the most commented stuff here is when I link up code. Those posts take a fairly substantial amount of time for me to complete as they are born of the result of my own frustration of hours spent tinkering with code, which I think might be useful for others to be clued up on. I also need time to gather my thoughts and structure what exactly I’m trying to say to people. This all adds up.</p>

<p>If I post more often, I fear the lesser quality of content might be pretty boring for the majority of people and probably not at all worthy of feedback from them. So I end up in a kind of stalemate position – should I post this/shouldn’t I/Oo-er and I don’t do anything. I’m not saying that I have a massive amount of visitors here, I’d just like them to enjoy the experience when they visit.</p>

<h1><a href="/2009/02/15/how-has-web-use-changed-your-life">How has web use changed your life?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">15 Feb 2009</div>
<p>I’ve been pondering this morning how the use of the internet has (or may have) changed my life. As a child/teen during the web’s infancy, I was blissfully unaware that so many lifes/careers/relationships would be enabled or changed as a result of the interactions it might facilitate. I hadn’t even heard of google prior to arriving at university and two years prior to that had never had internet access anywhere locally.<br />
I am sure my behaviour today would be pretty different if the web wasn’t around due to the massive impact its had in my world view. It seems a far smaller place and more tightly coupled. I feel free to drop messages to strangers and write blog posts into the ether. I won a T4 competition in my early uni years which landed me a car and £4k richer, which I wouldn’t have entered if I’d had to phone – so I’d definitely be poorer. There are however, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6187554.stm">examples</a> where the use of the web has had a detrimental effect on particular individual lives.</p>

<p>It’s a huge one to think about. Would my life be better as a result of the web having not been so widely adopted in the way it has? Would yours?</p>
