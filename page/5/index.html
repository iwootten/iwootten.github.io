      <div class="author_meta">21 Jan 2013</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve long made use of the default theme on WordPress, which I&#8217;ve always felt wasn&#8217;t entirely &#8220;me&#8221;. The theme now live is one I&#8217;ve been tinkering with for a while now based on the lovely preview design used in the <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a> document editing tool for github. I really like the focus on simplicity and think it suits me well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve added some different styling for the navigation elements, given they didn&#8217;t already exist on <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>. I&#8217;ve also added some subtle colour changes when navigating between pages, many of which are based on <a href="http://laurakalbag.com">Laura Kalbag</a>&#8216;s palettes over on <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/LJK">colour lovers</a>.</p>
<p>One of the things I hadn&#8217;t counted on was consolidating 10 years worth of blog posts into sensible categories as it was becoming a bit of a mess. When I first started blogging, wordpress didn&#8217;t exist, let alone tagging and I think I started out using categories in a manner to replicate them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a few things I&#8217;m not entirely happy with, such as how navigation is represented for single posts. I intend to tidy the theme up and release it back to the WordPress community, but for now I&#8217;m enjoying having finally got it out in the open. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">04 Jan 2013</div>

          <p>I feel compelled to write this post so late in the day after clocking <a href="https://gist.github.com/4454814">Tyler Renelle&#8217;s rant</a> on github about his problems with the popularity of certain JS frameworks (in the main <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>). After having written apps in a variety of JS frameworks (Backbone, Spine and Meteor), I&#8217;ve learned that the feature set of a framework is not the only thing I hold dear when making a choice between them.</p>
<p>Documentation, support, learning curve and most importantly community are what also guide me when building anything. If I need to make an app quickly, I&#8217;ll of course develop it in my favourite tool (Backbone), because I&#8217;ve been using it for years and therefore doesn&#8217;t hold a cost. If I have a problem, I know there&#8217;s a ton of hackers who&#8217;ve probably already worked on solutions already and mechanisms are in place for them to offer advice. There may be better documented more capable tools, but I can&#8217;t foot the expense in the short term that might come with investigating something new and run the risk of hitting problems I can&#8217;t solve. In the long term, as a framework grows in popularity and garners these other factors then I may make that jump. </p>
<p>The real reason these frameworks are popular right now is in part because they are already popular.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">02 Jan 2013</div>

          <p>So here we are in a brand new year. 2012 came and went without even the slightest apocalypse. Reflecting on what has been achieved this past year has found favour with others in the web profession so I thought I might try it. More importantly to me, it also seems like a good way to perhaps spur me on to achieve some firm targets this year.</p>
<p>My circumstances have dramatically changed since January last year. I&#8217;ve gone from full time employment as a frontend/backend developer for Aardman to being self employed as a frontend developer for the majority of the year. This was (and still is) a scary leap. Finding work, managing finances whilst still trying to be a good father/husband is a sometimes difficult balancing act to perform. So far though (after 9 months and counting), I&#8217;m enjoying it.</p>
<h2 id="events">Events</h2>
<p>The amount of conferences/meetups that have been organised this side of the bridge has been fantastic, especially where I&#8217;ve not had such a long commute this year. I&#8217;ve been able to head along regularly but have had to be fairly choosy about the amount of events I can attend. It&#8217;s great to see such a blossoming community round here. I&#8217;ve also thought about organising my own event, though I think I have enough on my plate at the moment.</p>
<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>
<p>JS has been my bread and butter this year. I&#8217;ve enjoyed digging deeper into various frontend frameworks and learning as much as I can about the language. Where I&#8217;ve known relatively little about the ins and outs of other backend languages, I feel like I actually have something to contribute here. I&#8217;ve continued tinkering with node.js on the backend and have used it as a build tool for much of the year. I spent some time learning a little Cocoa shortly after leaving Aardman and taking the <a href="https://education.10gen.com/">MongoDB developer training course by 10gen</a>. Whilst I found it difficult fitting the course in around everything, I can highly recommend it. I&#8217;ve even developed a couple of things myself, which I hope to tidy up and release over the coming year. I&#8217;ve not been able to write a great deal about what I&#8217;m learning, but hope that will soon change. Some of my most popular posts here relate to use of CouchDB and node.js from many moons ago.</p>
<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>
<p>I already had a number of side projects running before the start of last year but I&#8217;ve had a number of ideas for tools and a fairly major service I&#8217;d like to work on across 2012. I plan on releasing more details soon, but would love to have a recurring revenue stream from one of these coming in at some point this year. I find I can easily stray from this path and get distracted by other less fruitful ideas I have. I&#8217;m going to make it a resolution that I remain committed to one thing at a time, whilst putting to bed ideas that haven&#8217;t worked out.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>As much as I feel like I have adequate design chops, I&#8217;ve not had the opportunity to demonstrate them publicly. I&#8217;d love to redesign <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk">several</a> <a href="http://niftydigits.com">of my</a> <a href="http://fairandbare.com">sites</a> to a standard that I feel reflect my skills as a web craftsman. I&#8217;m currently working on developing a wordpress theme which I hope to contribute back to the community once I&#8217;m done.</p>
<p>So in all, it&#8217;s been a good, 2012. I&#8217;ve not fitted everything I might like in, but much of the content of my projects and work I had no idea about back at the start of last year. That also means you have something to look forward to from me in 2013. </p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2012/11/23/oh-crap-i-m-a-frontend-developer">Oh Crap, I&#39;m a Frontend Developer</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">23 Nov 2012</div>

          <p>When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000&#8242;s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites &#8211; that was it.</p>
<p>As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: &#8220;UX Designers&#8221; were the first to appear on the scene to me, and <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1596">we&#8217;re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails</a>. The one that particularly got my hair up though was a &#8220;Frontend Developer&#8221;. Basically, going from the skills that were listed with these roles (HTML, CSS, JS) it was a designer who could also do a bit of jQuery…. Not a real developer then. Not someone who pokes around with backend scripts and really knows what&#8217;s going on, right? Someone who can properly structure apps and create proper object oriented classes. It got my hair up because it seemed like an attempt to poach credentials from us hardworking devs. How dare they. Losers.</p>
<p>Time passed…. I got a real job….. The industry invented more job titles….</p>
<p>My first role was as a PHP/MySQL developer. I also started having to make decisions on frontend design and behaviour without having a formal education in either. I was, in my own projects at least, the only person to do such work. Outside of work during my first job, I decided to play with two hot technologies at the time: CouchDB and node.js. I geeked out about both, using document based stores and Javascript server-side &#8211; but hated the steep learning curve that came with having to use JS. It also missed many of the constructs I&#8217;d become used to in other languages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d seen a great deal of realtime apps and knew behaviour in my own apps should be keeping up. What I had could be better, much better. It was about here I probably started appreciating how much work was involved in a typical browser based app. I started using <a href="http://backbonejs.org">backbone.js</a> with a view to better organising the mess of JS that typically sat next to my markup. There wasn&#8217;t a great deal of help around, so I read a book as an aide….. I had to properly approach what was going on in the browser as I would do any other software. Hmm, weird. JS in the browser had up until now, been an afterthought to &#8220;jazz stuff up&#8221;. Developing real, well designed software in the browser however really floated my boat. I prototyped a simple calendar app and it worked fantastically well.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to move into a full time contract role as a Javascript Developer &#8211; or a Frontend Web Developer, if you like. I probably would have been shocked had someone suggested this 5 or so years ago.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really enjoying being part of the community around JS, the ever increasing list of libraries being posted and patterns for development. Hopefully I&#8217;ve learnt to be a little more discerning of job titles than I have been in the past.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">20 Nov 2012</div>

          <p>Given there&#8217;s a bit of lovefilm bashing <a href="http://www.tomalloyd.com/lovefilm-hate-email/">going on in Wales</a> at the moment, I thought I&#8217;d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm. </p>
<p>Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I&#8217;ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/emailpublic/cmsnewsletter/uk-newsletter/LOVEFiLM-Newsletter/2012/Newsletter-Issue-No-409?cid=lfnl409tlweb&#038;brand=lovefilm"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Read-Newsletter-Issue-409-5.jpg" alt="" title="Read Newsletter Issue 409 5" width="470" height="906" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-569" /></a></p>
<p>I really couldn&#8217;t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema&#8217;s to perform reviews and certainly don&#8217;t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image. </p>
<p>Also, the first thing I&#8217;m drawn to is the image. Why lead me away from the title of that movie and make work to find the text for the heading? Don&#8217;t make the title and preview exactly the same size, or divide them up!</p>
<p>End of rant.</p>
