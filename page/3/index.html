<h1><a href="/2012/11/23/oh-crap-im-a-frontend-developer">Oh Crap, I&#8217;m a Frontend Developer</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">23 Nov 2012</div>
<p>When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000′s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites – that was it.</p>

<p>As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: “UX Designers” were the first to appear on the scene to me, and <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1596">we’re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails</a>. The one that particularly got my hair up though was a “Frontend Developer”. Basically, going from the skills that were listed with these roles (HTML, CSS, JS) it was a designer who could also do a bit of jQuery…. Not a real developer then. Not someone who pokes around with backend scripts and really knows what’s going on, right? Someone who can properly structure apps and create proper object oriented classes. It got my hair up because it seemed like an attempt to poach credentials from us hardworking devs. How dare they. Losers.</p>

<p>Time passed…. I got a real job….. The industry invented more job titles….</p>

<p>My first role was as a PHP/MySQL developer. I also started having to make decisions on frontend design and behaviour without having a formal education in either. I was, in my own projects at least, the only person to do such work. Outside of work during my first job, I decided to play with two hot technologies at the time: CouchDB and node.js. I geeked out about both, using document based stores and Javascript server-side – but hated the steep learning curve that came with having to use JS. It also missed many of the constructs I’d become used to in other languages.</p>

<p>I’d seen a great deal of realtime apps and knew behaviour in my own apps should be keeping up. What I had could be better, much better. It was about here I probably started appreciating how much work was involved in a typical browser based app. I started using <a href="http://backbonejs.org">backbone.js</a> with a view to better organising the mess of JS that typically sat next to my markup. There wasn’t a great deal of help around, so I read a book as an aide….. I had to properly approach what was going on in the browser as I would do any other software. Hmm, weird. JS in the browser had up until now, been an afterthought to “jazz stuff up”. Developing real, well designed software in the browser however really floated my boat. I prototyped a simple calendar app and it worked fantastically well.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been lucky enough to move into a full time contract role as a Javascript Developer – or a Frontend Web Developer, if you like. I probably would have been shocked had someone suggested this 5 or so years ago.</p>

<p>I’m really enjoying being part of the community around JS, the ever increasing list of libraries being posted and patterns for development. Hopefully I’ve learnt to be a little more discerning of job titles than I have been in the past.</p>

<h1><a href="/2012/11/20/essential-cinema-lovefilm">Essential Cinema According to Lovefilm</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">20 Nov 2012</div>
<p>Given there’s a bit of lovefilm bashing <a href="http://www.tomalloyd.com/lovefilm-hate-email/">going on in Wales</a> at the moment, I thought I’d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm. </p>

<p>Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I’ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/emailpublic/cmsnewsletter/uk-newsletter/LOVEFiLM-Newsletter/2012/Newsletter-Issue-No-409?cid=lfnl409tlweb&#038;brand=lovefilm"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Read-Newsletter-Issue-409-5.jpg" alt="" title="Read Newsletter Issue 409 5" width="470" height="906" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-569" /></a></p>

<p>I really couldn’t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema’s to perform reviews and certainly don’t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image. </p>

<p>Also, the first thing I’m drawn to is the image. Why lead me away from the title of that movie and make work to find the text for the heading? Don’t make the title and preview exactly the same size, or divide them up!</p>

<p>End of rant.</p>

<h1><a href="/2012/09/04/recovering-images-from-sd-cards-with-photorec">Recovering Images from SD Cards with PhotoRec</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">04 Sep 2012</div>
<p>I had the horrible situation last Sunday following removing a number of pictures using an SD reader from my SD card that when I inserted it in my camera, it registered nothing upon it. My heart sunk, because this card is stuffed full of images of me and my family (along with my 1 year old son growing up) and I was unsure of which ones I’d actually backed up. After perusing the hidden files on the card, all I could discover was the files I’d most recently transferred from the card….great…</p>

<p>Partly this was my own fault – I’d already experienced problems with the reader in question when trying to write images for my <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> and shouldn’t have used it for transferring images I care about. The card in question is a uber cheapo <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Integral-USB-Single-Slot-Reader/dp/B000VY80AM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1346533453&#038;sr=8-1">Integral USB 2.0</a>. Despite what the amazon reviews say, steer well clear of it – this has been a pain from day one, with intermittent transfer problems which triggered this situation.</p>

<p>After a little more digging, I came across <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">Photorec</a>, a commandline utility which seemed like it would hopefully help recover some of the images. I attempted to use it with my card reader, but given it’s credentials I’ve given above, found the scanning process would cut out and couldn’t get through the whole card. At this point the card was being reported empty….great…Given the way PhotoRec works, I understood it would still be possible to extract the images despite this. I decided to order another reader and hold fire until it had arrived – this time I opted for a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingston-Technology-Multi-Card-Reader/dp/B007PFQ0PC/">Kingston USB 3.0</a> (which I haven’t had any such problems with so far).</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I followed after receiving my new sd reader to recover images from the card using PhotoRec. I’m listing them for anyone else who may have the same horrendous stomach wrenching problem I did last Sunday. It seems to have worked pretty well, with only 1 movie file coming out corrupted and about 500 images recovered.</p>

<p>Firstly, I wanted to take a copy of the card as it currently stood following my investigation. For this I used df, diskutil and ddrescue.</p>

<p>To determine where the card is currently mounted (look for the one that’s about the right size):</p>

<pre class="bash">df -h
</pre>

<p>To unmount the card so we can fiddle with it:</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
</pre>

<p>To backup the card to a disk image on your macbook:</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo ddrescue /dev/disk1s1 ./sdbackup/image.img backuplog
</pre>

<p>Finally, using PhotoRec scan the disk image that was just created. My image was FAT formatted I scanned the whole thing rather than just unallocated blocks.</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo ./photorec ~/sdbackup/image.img
</pre>

<p>The final piece of this saga was to rename all the files PhotoRec created so they were in folders according to their exif data. My photos are all in folders like “2012_06_30″, so to have 500 files named “f0677440.jpg”, “f0688768.jpg” in a random PhotoRec directory would be pretty annoying. I had looked at setting up an automator task for this, but I ended up using <a href="http://www.petrosit.de/index.php/apps/12-pexiftool">PexifTool</a> for simplicities sake (I’m sure there are other alternatives). I believe if you go the Automator route, you may well have to install plugins in order to be able to extract exif data from files.</p>

<p>This is a talk I did back in May at <a href="http://unifieddiff.co.uk">unifieddiff</a> about my time working as a web developer at Aardman Features. I talk quite a bit about the production process and what we take from staff in order to help them do their jobs properly.

<p>What are you doing? Why would you go down that road? Shouldn’t you be building something else? How long have you been doing this?</p>

<p>Sure you can fool your clients into thinking you’re adding value to their product. I know the truth. But how did you – with all your expertise get to the point in thinking that’s what you’re really doing?</p>

<p>This is your first project? Shouldn’t you be focusing on your clients problems? </p>

<p>Why are you busily building a framework, when you’re already overdue? You know there’s any flavour of ORM available already right? What’s wrong with you? Where are your requirements?</p>

<p>Do you think that you’re going to be able to produce something better than the thousands of contributors to that open source project you’re avoiding using? They’ve been doing it for years already, for thousands of use cases. You think somehow yours falls outside it’s catchment area? Seriously? How arrogant are you?</p>

<p>You’ve been blinkered into thinking you’re an expert in areas you’re not. When your time is spent solving the wrong problems and you’re not invited back, I hope you’ll realise that you’re nowhere near as good a hacker as you think.</p>

<div class="author_meta">03 May 2012</div>
<p>If my years in academia have taught me anything, it’s that insight obvious to you isn’t often obvious to others. </p>

<p>As a result, I’ve pretty much adopted a gung-ho hacker attitude towards getting my own ideas built whereby I’ll just often work to get an iteration of an site out as fast as possible. The only factor here is my own time and I’m in the fortunate position to have some of that available now and again. There’s a variety of reasons why I might attempt a project, ranging from it may later evolve into something able to draw an income further down the line, that I’m excited by learning from the tools I choose to use or that I feel moved enough by a problem to do something to try and prompt change. </p>

<p>I had one of these ideas last weekend, whereby I was wondering what the specifics of the fees of kickstarter projects broke down to. The information on what fees are taken is published <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creating%20a%20project#WhatFeesDoesKickChar" title="what fees does kickstarter charge">on their site</a>, so I set about a simple phantomjs script (available <a href="https://github.com/niftydigits/kickstarter.js">on github</a>) that could scrape the information from kickstarter. After doing so, the idea moved on to graphing said information via an app to a simple raphaeljs and again further once I’d realised some other stats that could be gathered from the info I was grabbing. The end result is <a href="http://starterstats.com">Starter Stats</a> – which is, (I think) a neat little site for showing stats on any kickstarter project.</p>

<p><a href="http://starterstats.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-03-at-10.16.42-1024x817.png" alt="" title="Starter Stats" width="640" height="510" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-536" /></a></p>

<p>It took a little longer than I’d hoped, but I’m really pleased with the final site as it stands. You should also be able to just replace the beginning of any kickstarter project page (http://kickstarter.com) with “http://starterstats.com” and you’ll be sent to the relevant stats page on the app. Pages are generated on-demand every 15 minutes. Go on, take a look and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>I could have not spent my time on this, instead kicking back and waiting for someone else to build such a tool. But I couldn’t see that happening. No, better for me to build, learn whilst doing so and move on to my next project. What do you get by not building?</p>

<h1><a href="/2012/03/01/how-to-switch-your-vps-in-2-hours">How to Switch Your VPS in 2 Hours</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">01 Mar 2012</div>
<p>Friday last week I woke up to a barrage of emails coming into my inbox. All of these were coming from notification of spam comments upon this very blog. By the time I’d woken up I’d had something like 75 emails. This was pretty strange given that Akismet was there guarding my blog ever since it’s been available and I’d never had a email about a dodgy comment since I’d set it up (something like 5 years ago). They continued to flood in during my breakfast as fast as I could delete them.</p>

<p>The problem stemmed from the fact that network connectivity from my slicehost account had been knocked out of action – which had never happened before. I presumed this was down to the migration of slicehost over to Rackspace infrastructure, which I’d been informed of, but the network dying was probably unintended.</p>

<p>Either way, it was frustrating and I instantly decided to finally migrate away from slicehost and setup a second linode account. The funny thing is, that most of this was aided by slicehosts own documentation on configuring your server. If you’re doing little more than hosting a number of mysql / php driven sites, it is in fact really simple to switch. Here’s how I went about it, my sites all experience fairly low traffic, so I’m aware this solution might not be right for everyone.</p>

<h2 id="backup-all-your-important-data">Backup All Your Important Data</h2>

<p>First of all, you’re going to need to backup everything you have in your sites directory. For me, that’s everything under /var/www.</p>

<pre class="bash">tar -zcvf backup-feb-2012.tar.gz /var/www</pre>

<p>Next, you’ll want to do the same for your Apache sites:</p>

<pre class="bash">tar -zcvf backup-apache-feb-2012.tar.gz /etc/apache2/sites-available</pre>

<p>Finally, I took a mysqldump of my entire mysql setup:</p>

<pre class="bash">mysqldump —-all-databases -u root -p password | gzip &gt;dbbackup-feb-2012.sql.gz</pre>

<h2 id="setup-your-new-vps">Setup Your New VPS</h2>

<p>Having done that, you have pretty much everything you need to bring your server back to life as it is now. Go and grab a new vps from linode or somewhere else and set it up using the details starting from here: <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/10/18/ubuntu-maverick-setup-part-1">http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/10/18/ubuntu-maverick-setup-part-1</a> I configured my vps to have exactly the same accounts and passwords as my original vps, to make life easier for me. Once SSH and your firewall has been setup and you’re all updated, you’ll be able to transfer all the files you just created onto your fresh vps setup, using filezilla, or a direct connection between the two machines. You’ll then need to install Apache: <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/5/19/installing-apache-on-ubuntu">http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/5/19/installing-apache-on-ubuntu</a>, PHP: <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/5/19/installing-php-on-ubuntu">http://articles.slicehost.com/2010/5/19/installing-php-on-ubuntu</a> and MySQL: <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/2011/3/10/installing-mysql-server-on-ubuntu">http://articles.slicehost.com/2011/3/10/installing-mysql-server-on-ubuntu</a></p>

<p>On your new machine, you’ll need to restore the files you backed up to /var/www.</p>

<pre class="bash">tar -xzf backup-feb-2012.tar.gz
sudo cp -r var/www/* /var/www/
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/*
rm -rf ~/var</pre>

<p>Then the apache site files:</p>

<pre class="bash">tar -xzf backup-apache-feb-2012.tar.gz
sudo cp etc/apache2/sites-available/* /etc/apache2/sites-available/</pre>

<p>For every file that exists in the sites directory and is to be enabled, we need to enable it. You can use a2ensite for this if you like.</p>

<pre class="bash">cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/ianwootten.co.uk.conf ianwootten.co.uk.conf (for each site file)</pre>

<p>Install any apache modules you might require and restart apache. If you’re using wordpress or a php framework like me, you’ll most likely need mod_rewrite.</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart</pre>

<p>You’ll then need to repopulate your new mysql install with all your old data.</p>

<pre class="bash">gunzip -c databasebackup.sql.gz | mysql -u root -p</pre>

<h2 id="configure-email">Configure Email</h2>

<p>I use msmtp to handle all my email on my server, which sends through a single gmail automailer address for my domain. If you want to send email that way do the following:</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo apt-get install msmtp ca-certificates
sudo nano /etc/msmtprc</pre>

<p>Paste the following setup in the file:</p>

<p>`defaults<br />
tls             on<br />
tls_starttls    on<br />
tls_trust_file  /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>account default<br />
host            smtp.gmail.com<br />
port            587<br />
auto_from       off<br />
auth            on<br />
user            automailer@somedomain.com<br />
password        mymailpass<br />
from            automailer@somedomain.com<br />
maildomain      somedomain.com<br />
logfile		/var/log/msmtp.log`

<pre class="bash">sudo chmod 0644 /etc/msmtprc</pre>

You can test whether it’s working using a the command as:

<pre class="bash">echo -e "Subject: A Test Email\r\n\r\nThis is a test" |msmtp --debug --from=default -t mymail@gmail.com</pre>

## Configure DNS

You need to configure how your vps is going to handle particular requests for various domains. You’ve probably had to do this already with your current vps, so just copy the entries through whatever management system your new host provides. For sites that have a fairly simple setup, your host may provide a simple set of default entries to use, or you can clone entries that have the same setup as each other.

We’re now at the point where we have a complete copy of our vps up and running, and the vps knows how to handle requests for domains, however currently our domain registrar points to our old vps, so the requests will never reach our new server. Head to your domain registrar and change the entries for a single domain, to point to your new vps (ns1.linode.com, ns2.linode.com etc). Now sit and wait patiently….Once that domain has propagated correctly (ping it to see if has a new or old ip), and you’re happy your site is working as expected, go ahead and change all of your domains dns entries to the ip address of your new vps.

## Relax&#8230;

All in all, I don&#8217;t think this took me more than a couple of hours working with the terminal open. I certainly didn&#8217;t worry about migrating in the way I have done previously. As I opted for a uk datacentre with linode, a side effect of the change is all my sites are much much faster &#8211; and a better setup with linode is in fact cheaper than slicehost. I left my slicehost account running for an entire week prior to shutting it down yesterday &#8211; just in case&#8230;

<h1><a href="/2012/02/16/wheres-my-full-stack-payment-service">Where&#8217;s my Full Stack Payment Service?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 Feb 2012</div>
<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ll realise that there’s an uprising against paypal amongst developers. Most of this stems from the multitude of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/12/06/paypal-to-regretsy-sorry-_n_1132679.html">crazy requirements</a> they put upon sellers and the locks they can put upon your account without notice.</p>

<p>This in part has led to a number of payment alternatives cropping up. Here in the UK for instance, you have Google checkout and checkout by Amazon pitching up against paypal. None of these solutions are ideal though if you’re looking to make say, a service that bills on a monthly basis.</p>

<p>Enter the subscription billing tools – there’s <a href="http://recurly.com/">recurly</a>, <a href="http://chargify.com/">Chargify</a> and <a href="http://saasy.com/">Saasy</a>, to name 3. All of these go some way to ease the management of customer subscriptions. This is great if you have an established banking history as a business and are able to get hold of a merchant account. Not so great for me – an independent developer with neither of those.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, a full-stack payment processor for developers which has no requirement on merchant accounts or gateways. Integration with your own website is as simple as pasting in some javascript. Sounds great…..Except I need to be in the US to use it. *Facepalm*. I even had beta access to stripe in it’s infancy and just had to smile at my invitation code.</p>

<p>Recently here in the UK, <a href="http://gocardless.com">Go Cardless</a> has appeared with an interesting model, based around the use of direct debits to set up subscriptions and make payments. That strikes me as a little weird from a customer point of view. I’m ok paying my gas by direct debit, but would I be ok paying for a piece of software? Given it’s unusual for a website to bill this way, I’d argue most people wouldn’t be.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for us independent developers in the UK, Go Cardless really is our best option until Stripe or some other full stack offering lands here. I know Stripe are supposedly working hard on doing so, but payments are at an incredibly frustrating point here right now.</p>

<div class="author_meta">23 Jan 2012</div>
<p>Last week, like many others working on the web, I took the trip to Nottingham for <a href="http://2012.newadventuresconf.com/">New Adventures 2012</a>. I’d seen the wonderful praise dished out for it last year and felt like I wanted to see what it was all about first hand. </p>

<p>I’ve learnt from experience that the most important part of any conference is not the talks or speakers involved, but the community around it and therefore I headed up the night before to ensure I didn’t miss a thing.</p>

<p>Colly and his team had done a lovely job of organising enough to keep us busy what with bowling, screenprinting, fr00tball, the after party and of course the main event.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small.jpg"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/20120119_092906_small-1024x768.jpg" alt="" title="The Albert Hall" width="640" height="480" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-515" /></a></p>

<p>Despite not actually branding myself as a web designer, it was great to feel welcomed and able to chat one on one with others about our day to day work. Dan Mall’s talked helped somewhat here, forcing introductions with everyone around me. I’m pretty much work in solitary confinement as a developer and to discuss the thoughts and ideas I have with other like minded creatives is always welcome.</p>

<p>During a dinner following the conference, another dev commented that the most of the presentations weren’t specific to web design. They were in fact so abstract, that it was more a “Self Help Class for Web Designers”. I pretty much agree with this. But that’s with a caveat – what else do you attend these presentations for? NA Conf is there to share, inspire and enable designers to be better designers. I want to leave giddy eyed with possibilities. Remember there are workshops too for specifics…</p>

<p>After the whole conference, I feel like there’s a whole lot more I could do to better myself at my craft. Hopefully over the course of the year I’ll do something about it. Most of the notes I made are to this effect too and I’m sure I’ll take away something different each time I look at them.</p>

<p>There’s only so much that can be covered in 45 mins, and for me I want to see a speaker paint me the big picture. After NAConf, I’ve got a whole bunch of big pictures to get through.</p>
