      <div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2013</div>

          <p>10 years ago today, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That&#8217;s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that&#8217;s quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 &#8220;weblog tool&#8221;</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>
<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed &#8211; I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently &#8211; which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I&#8217;m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I&#8217;m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it&#8217;s the moments I don&#8217;t share that are most important to me.</p>
<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Jul 2013</div>

          <p>I decided to attempt a simple app this week, first using <a href="http://gocardless.com">GoCardless</a>, then later the <a href="http://stripe.com">beta of Stripe</a>. It requires the payment of funds between two individuals, neither of which might be a business. GoCardless suggests signing up to use their <a href="https://gocardless.com/docs/partner_guide">partner programme</a>, which involves registering a user as a merchant. This isn&#8217;t entirely suitable given the individual will be asked many queries on the nature of their business (which they don&#8217;t have). Stripe have a similar offering, known as <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">&#8220;Connect&#8221;</a> which asks similar questions. It&#8217;s at this point users would probably start turning away.</p>
<p>The recently announced <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/send-payouts-with-stripe">&#8220;Payouts&#8221;</a> from Stripe, seems like the most appropriate solution, but it doesn&#8217;t yet exist in the UK (and it&#8217;ll probably be a while before it does). Bigger players like Amazon&#8217;s fps require that you have a US card and haven&#8217;t ever made noises that they may be expanding into European markets.</p>
<p>As developers in the UK, we get a bit of a bum deal. Software products are often first targeted towards the biggest (US) market and we fine folks have to sit around and wait until the smaller pieces of the puzzle are picked up and put in place. Sucks to be us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged in the past about the many payment providers cropping up and their services being unavailable in the UK. I can understand why this happens, but it&#8217;s frustrating not least because it hinders any momentum that might be able to be built at an earlier date. </p>
<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll ever have the same momentum as I did with my idea this week. It&#8217;s unlikely therefore, it will ever see the light of day. A US counterpart could easily offer an international version of my idea today.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">27 Jun 2013</div>

          <p>I suffer from idea overload. It seems that every day I have an idea for something. As a developer, I&#8217;m lucky in that to be able to take an idea to inception very quickly. Best of all, I can show it at inception stage to a huge audience (if I had one), garner feedback and quickly iterate on that idea. To date, I&#8217;ve mainly created these by myself &#8211; a casualty of doing paid work in the main like this too. </p>
<p>Most of these ideas in the have been simple hacks &#8211; <a href="http://loveletterd.com">solutions to things that bug me</a>. <a href="http://fairandbare.com">One of them has been a proper business too</a>. I&#8217;m able to do something and make it happen, to potentially tap a huge audience. Get them to that first step. The problem I have is, not a single one of these so much as turns a profit, though they serve as wonderful educational devices for me. I would hazard a guess that some of them have indirectly got me work.</p>
<p>Some of my ideas never get past the domain registration phase before being knocked on the head. A friend many years ago gave me the great quote that &#8216;My domains are my todo list&#8217;. This totally hits the nail on the head for me &#8211; if I&#8217;ve felt like an idea was good enough to make it to the registration phase, there&#8217;s something there worth pursuing. Unfortunately, I have quite a long list to work through.</p>
<p>I heard it said that &#8220;The Developer Dream&#8221; is that we (developers) &#8220;build a product/service which we&#8217;re able to earn a living from&#8221;. But the majority of developers I know, don&#8217;t even begin to pursue the ideas they have. This surprises me. </p>
<p>There seems to be such an abundance of opportunities that I can&#8217;t imagine not building my own ideas, however bad they might seem to others. </p>
<p>Why hold back? Time? Yes, we have other commitments &#8211; family, work and maybe even a hobby or two. I&#8217;m not suggesting we make drastic sacrifices or sell our kids in order to create stuff. I&#8217;d would however, like to think that the payoff for building our ideas might make our initial holdups seem insignificant longer term. <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/05/03/if-you-build-it">I&#8217;ve said it before</a> and I can&#8217;t speak from as the voice of successful experience, but what do I get out of never trying?</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/04/03/the-problem-with-full-stack-js-applications">The Problem with Full Stack JS Applications</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">03 Apr 2013</div>

          <p>Whilst node.js heralded an era of being able to use a single language for both server and client side development, nobody mentioned the confusion such an approach could cause. It&#8217;s inevitable that there&#8217;s going to be similarities in code that constructs data on the server and that which presents it on the client. The fact that the two are written in the same language and the structure of them is so tightly coupled can make it easy to lose track of where you are and what you&#8217;re doing when knee deep in code.</p>
<p>Having primarily been using a full js stack (express on the server, backbone on the client) for side projects over the last year or so, I&#8217;ve certainly found myself tied up in this kind of knot. For example, if I&#8217;m looking at event.js, which represents an event on a calendar it could be the server event representation, used as an accessor for a db or a client side backbone model presenting the events attributes as part of a view. Usually (if you&#8217;re using a sensible class naming scheme) it is enough to know the file (.php or .js) within which you&#8217;re working and if that&#8217;s not enough, then the language syntax usually is a dead giveaway for where you are in your codebase. But this isn&#8217;t the case when working in one language. My guess is you&#8217;re going to have to take a second glance in order to figure out where you are, which isn&#8217;t a big issue, but is frustrating.</p>
<p>Currently my apps typically are structured like this:</p>
<p>server.js (Main node/express file)<br>-lib (Classes for DB Calls)<br>-node_modules (Node requires)<br>-public (Client backbone app)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-css<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-images<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-lib (Backbone and other dependencies)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-collections<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-models<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-templates<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-views<br>-routes (Contains the main express routes)</p>
<p>But I actually think the following is a better approach:</p>
<p>-server<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server.js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-lib<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-node_modules<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-routes<br>-client (Renamed from public)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-css<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-images<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-lib<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-collections<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-models<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-templates<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-views</p>
<p>At least with the second approach, it is easier to have a clear idea of where to find classes on first opening them. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t however solve my problem of moving between server side and client logic and pausing for a moment before realising I am where I need to work. This is a first world problem for which I don&#8217;t believe there is a solution.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/03/28/so-you-want-to-run-a-fairtrade-business">So You Want to Run a Fairtrade Business?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">28 Mar 2013</div>

          <p>This is a brief retrospective of what I&#8217;ve learned in the 6 years I&#8217;ve been running <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com" title="Fair &#038; Bare">Fair &#038; Bare</a>, a Fairtrade t-shirt company along with my wife. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a new follower of mine, you heard right &#8211; <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">I run a Fairtrade t-shirt company</a>. I&#8217;ve not actively been marketing it more recently for a number of reasons, but I still have a strong belief in our original vision. That vision was that Fairtrade shirts at the time weren&#8217;t being well received by the world, despite being available. We believed they could be, if we were only to find some that had good designs (and were possibly less &#8216;preachy&#8217;).</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s what we set out to do. From 2007-2011 we were running as an online design competition, inspired mainly by Threadless and Emptees, and helped via a great community of designers through a site I built entirely myself (whilst doing a PhD, getting married and buying a house). I&#8217;ve since learned that I don&#8217;t believe the competition sourced design is the best fit for what we are trying to do, but it constantly excited me that we *could* do it. I still hope some day to be proved wrong though.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2>
<p>The Ethical market pales in comparison to the cheaper alternatives. That probably won&#8217;t come as news to you. Most people &#8211; like it or not, will buy cheap over quality if they&#8217;re perceived to be comparable. This has certainly been my experience so far, having touted our wares at student markets, Fairtrade stalls and online. Be prepared to experience it first hand, and to repeatedly go over your story to get people to part with their cash. That is, after all, your unique selling point.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re at it, if you&#8217;re selling online, be prepared to experience the same. When so much hard work has gone into creating your goods, you&#8217;ll find it heartbreaking to have a couple of people take up an offer from a newsletter of thousands. My advice would be not to get your hopes up….</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t entirely despair. When you make those few sales you&#8217;ll feel such a strong connection with your customer, even though you may never meet them. Repeat customers will give you a warm glow inside and smile all day long.</p>
<p>The Fairtrade supply chain is slow(er) and (more) fallible. We constantly had trouble with every supplier we used for our shirts over how quickly we could obtain stock and sometimes with the stock itself. Obviously, once our community had selected a design, we wanted it printed and available for sale. We knew we would have to wait for designs to be printed, but what we hadn&#8217;t counted on was how long it could take to get hold of shirts we&#8217;d ordered. Other businesses might be able to cope better with such delays. 2 months to go from selected to online is not ideal for our business model that relies on constant momentum, especially when we were dealing with a a single product at a time. </p>
<p>Depending on your supplier, you may also experience variations in sizes and colour. Be wary, you&#8217;re going to have to deal with all the resulting issues that arise from these problems with your customers or be lumbered with stock you&#8217;re unable to shift.</p>
<p>Times are hard for everyone. Since having started, 2 of the 3 suppliers we used have shut up shop and the third has changed it&#8217;s supplier. This has drastically reduced the options for us to the point of being unviable, which is one of the reasons we haven&#8217;t put out a new design since 2011. (If anyone is able to point me in the direction of other wholesale ethical brands, I&#8217;d be keen to hear about them).</p>
<p>Fairtrade cotton, Fairtrade or fair trade? Organic? Soil association certified? You need to be aware of the differences, because competitors will use similar terms. Even though they mean different things to you, most customers don&#8217;t know the difference and lump them all in the same good for the producer pot.</p>
<p>First impressions count. Originally, we used to send out our t-shirts in recycled packaging we sourced from envelopes we had kicking around our house. I have to cringe at this now &#8211; the idea that old crumply packets were being received with sticky-taped-on labels. That was our first physical impression on our customer. *Sigh*. Our heart was in the right place though, we didn&#8217;t (and still don&#8217;t) want to be creating more waste. We&#8217;ve since moved on to shipping goods out in recycled packets.</p>
<p>Marketing is key. When you&#8217;re not marketing your goods, you&#8217;re not seen to be active. Just by talking about your business, you&#8217;ll get interest in your product and make sales. Our buzz came from regular competitions and launches of new shirts. With every new shirt we&#8217;d let our mailing list, community and followers know of its arrival.</p>
<p>Finally, a word on branding. I constantly wrestle with wether we would have been better off branding ourselves first and foremost a t-shirt design company, rather than a Fairtrade one. I think the answer is yes. Our whole ethos was originally based around the lack of well designed Fairtrade shirts. Ultimately, if a design looks good, a customer is going to be happy paying a little more if it&#8217;s what they want. The ethical aspect of the cotton is, in their mind, a bonus. But if they&#8217;re not even visiting your site or stall because they see you first and foremost as an ethical brand, and that doesn&#8217;t entirely float their boat, then you&#8217;ve lost a sale.</p>
<p>The whole experience of running <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> has been a bit of a roller coaster of highs and lows. I&#8217;ve learned so much from running it and hope to continue to do so.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be right of me to post about <a href="http://www.fairandbare.com">Fair &#038; Bare</a> here without letting my readers in on a special offer. For this Easter weekend, when you buy two shirts, you&#8217;ll get the third free on using the code &#8220;EASTEREGG&#8221; when checking out.</p>
