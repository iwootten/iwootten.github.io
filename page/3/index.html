      <div class="author_meta">27 Oct 2013</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve purchased a couple of .is straight from the Icelandic Domain Registry (ISNIC) in the past year with a view to using them with my own vps. The process of setting up nameservers isn&#8217;t great, given their somewhat confusing management interface. That&#8217;s summed up in a recent tweet below.</p>
<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Looks like I just spent 39 euros on a domain I canâ€™t use. Fucksticks.</p>&mdash; Craig Lockwood (@craiginwales) <a href="https://twitter.com/craiginwales/statuses/394167434196058112">October 26, 2013</a></blockquote></p>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Given the potential savings compared to a &#8216;normal&#8217; registrar, it&#8217;s likely you&#8217;ll want to make use of ISNIC themselves &#8211; who are much like an Icelandic version of Nominet.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the process I went through to configure my domain to make use of the nameservers provided by my (non-icelandic) host. The information provided <a href="http://web.peterhartree.co.uk/2012/how-to-register-an-icelandic-is-domain-name/">here</a> is a little misleading as it&#8217;s not necessary to use a &#8220;pre-approved&#8221; registrar according to the rules outlined <a href="https://www.isnic.is/en/host/req">here</a>. To be clear, there&#8217;s no need to use something like x.is, and you can point ISNIC directly to your hosts nameservers.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve gone through the process of checking your domain is available and registering it, you&#8217;ll need to ensure your hosting provider has appropriate dns entries for your domain. If you&#8217;re using, cPanel or something that basically means adding it there. If you&#8217;re managing your own dns entries, add the appropriate entries within your manager.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the key bit. Now wait&#8230;. Seriously, for about 6 hours or so do something else. It will take some time for these dns changes to propagate and ISNIC to accept them. Basically these details need to be bounced up through the hierarchy of dns servers to the root dns servers that will respond to a request for your new domain, which takes time. In the olden days, I remember waiting days for this to happen.</p>
<p>Following that wait, head to the &#8220;redelegate&#8221; option within your new &#8220;My Page&#8221; area at ISNIC. Choose the &#8220;Not Registered&#8221; when asked for your ISP.</p>
<p>Go ahead and enter the nameservers you want to use. If the dns changes haven&#8217;t yet propagated, you&#8217;ll probably get the error &#8220;The nameserver &#8216;ns1.whatever.com&#8217; has not been registered&#8221;, as shown below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-23.57.26.png"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Screen-Shot-2013-10-26-at-23.57.26.png" alt="Misleading Error" width="676" height="360" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-912" /></a></p>
<p>This is a pretty misleading error, given what it actually means is &#8220;your domain doesn&#8217;t seem to be registered yet on those nameservers&#8221;. So wait a bit more for propagation to occur&#8230;</p>
<p>Be aware of the <a href="https://www.isnic.is/en/host/req">rules</a> for ISNIC nameservers and check your host complies with them, otherwise you may find you encounter other errors. When the changes are picked up, you should finally be able to add the entries without getting an array of red boxes, much like below.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Aug 2013</div>

          <p>10 years ago today, <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install">I started this blog</a>. That&#8217;s just under a 3rd of my life. In other words, that&#8217;s quite a long time ago.</p>
<p>I started out using Movable type and very quickly (3 days later) <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/17/all-change">ditched it</a> in favour of the <a href="http://cafelog.com">b2 &#8220;weblog tool&#8221;</a>, which WordPress was later spawned from.</p>
<p>Back then, I blogged frequently about what was going on in my life, which tended to centre around University coursework rather than technical posts. These days, a lot has changed &#8211; I have a wife, son, house, business and as a result, blog a lot less frequently &#8211; which honestly, upsets me a little.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also crazy to look at the progress of WordPress over that time and how now, ten years on I&#8217;m considering moving away to a simpler, static tool.</p>
<p>Given it&#8217;s now my industry, it would be easy for me to ponder what might have been over my time on the web (what if this, that..) but I&#8217;m left thinking that for all the facets of my life I do make visible on my blog, it&#8217;s the moments I don&#8217;t share that are most important to me.</p>
<p>I wonder what the next decade will bring.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Jul 2013</div>

          <p>I decided to attempt a simple app this week, first using <a href="http://gocardless.com">GoCardless</a>, then later the <a href="http://stripe.com">beta of Stripe</a>. It requires the payment of funds between two individuals, neither of which might be a business. GoCardless suggests signing up to use their <a href="https://gocardless.com/docs/partner_guide">partner programme</a>, which involves registering a user as a merchant. This isn&#8217;t entirely suitable given the individual will be asked many queries on the nature of their business (which they don&#8217;t have). Stripe have a similar offering, known as <a href="https://stripe.com/connect">&#8220;Connect&#8221;</a> which asks similar questions. It&#8217;s at this point users would probably start turning away.</p>
<p>The recently announced <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/send-payouts-with-stripe">&#8220;Payouts&#8221;</a> from Stripe, seems like the most appropriate solution, but it doesn&#8217;t yet exist in the UK (and it&#8217;ll probably be a while before it does). Bigger players like Amazon&#8217;s fps require that you have a US card and haven&#8217;t ever made noises that they may be expanding into European markets.</p>
<p>As developers in the UK, we get a bit of a bum deal. Software products are often first targeted towards the biggest (US) market and we fine folks have to sit around and wait until the smaller pieces of the puzzle are picked up and put in place. Sucks to be us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve blogged in the past about the many payment providers cropping up and their services being unavailable in the UK. I can understand why this happens, but it&#8217;s frustrating not least because it hinders any momentum that might be able to be built at an earlier date. </p>
<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll ever have the same momentum as I did with my idea this week. It&#8217;s unlikely therefore, it will ever see the light of day. A US counterpart could easily offer an international version of my idea today.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">27 Jun 2013</div>

          <p>I suffer from idea overload. It seems that every day I have an idea for something. As a developer, I&#8217;m lucky in that to be able to take an idea to inception very quickly. Best of all, I can show it at inception stage to a huge audience (if I had one), garner feedback and quickly iterate on that idea. To date, I&#8217;ve mainly created these by myself &#8211; a casualty of doing paid work in the main like this too. </p>
<p>Most of these ideas in the have been simple hacks &#8211; <a href="http://loveletterd.com">solutions to things that bug me</a>. <a href="http://fairandbare.com">One of them has been a proper business too</a>. I&#8217;m able to do something and make it happen, to potentially tap a huge audience. Get them to that first step. The problem I have is, not a single one of these so much as turns a profit, though they serve as wonderful educational devices for me. I would hazard a guess that some of them have indirectly got me work.</p>
<p>Some of my ideas never get past the domain registration phase before being knocked on the head. A friend many years ago gave me the great quote that &#8216;My domains are my todo list&#8217;. This totally hits the nail on the head for me &#8211; if I&#8217;ve felt like an idea was good enough to make it to the registration phase, there&#8217;s something there worth pursuing. Unfortunately, I have quite a long list to work through.</p>
<p>I heard it said that &#8220;The Developer Dream&#8221; is that we (developers) &#8220;build a product/service which we&#8217;re able to earn a living from&#8221;. But the majority of developers I know, don&#8217;t even begin to pursue the ideas they have. This surprises me. </p>
<p>There seems to be such an abundance of opportunities that I can&#8217;t imagine not building my own ideas, however bad they might seem to others. </p>
<p>Why hold back? Time? Yes, we have other commitments &#8211; family, work and maybe even a hobby or two. I&#8217;m not suggesting we make drastic sacrifices or sell our kids in order to create stuff. I&#8217;d would however, like to think that the payoff for building our ideas might make our initial holdups seem insignificant longer term. <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/05/03/if-you-build-it">I&#8217;ve said it before</a> and I can&#8217;t speak from as the voice of successful experience, but what do I get out of never trying?</p>

          <h1><a href="/2013/04/03/the-problem-with-full-stack-js-applications">The Problem with Full Stack JS Applications</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">03 Apr 2013</div>

          <p>Whilst node.js heralded an era of being able to use a single language for both server and client side development, nobody mentioned the confusion such an approach could cause. It&#8217;s inevitable that there&#8217;s going to be similarities in code that constructs data on the server and that which presents it on the client. The fact that the two are written in the same language and the structure of them is so tightly coupled can make it easy to lose track of where you are and what you&#8217;re doing when knee deep in code.</p>
<p>Having primarily been using a full js stack (express on the server, backbone on the client) for side projects over the last year or so, I&#8217;ve certainly found myself tied up in this kind of knot. For example, if I&#8217;m looking at event.js, which represents an event on a calendar it could be the server event representation, used as an accessor for a db or a client side backbone model presenting the events attributes as part of a view. Usually (if you&#8217;re using a sensible class naming scheme) it is enough to know the file (.php or .js) within which you&#8217;re working and if that&#8217;s not enough, then the language syntax usually is a dead giveaway for where you are in your codebase. But this isn&#8217;t the case when working in one language. My guess is you&#8217;re going to have to take a second glance in order to figure out where you are, which isn&#8217;t a big issue, but is frustrating.</p>
<p>Currently my apps typically are structured like this:</p>
<p>server.js (Main node/express file)<br>-lib (Classes for DB Calls)<br>-node_modules (Node requires)<br>-public (Client backbone app)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-css<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-images<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-lib (Backbone and other dependencies)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-collections<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-models<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-templates<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-views<br>-routes (Contains the main express routes)</p>
<p>But I actually think the following is a better approach:</p>
<p>-server<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server.js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-lib<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-node_modules<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-routes<br>-client (Renamed from public)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-css<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-images<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-js<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-lib<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-collections<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-models<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-templates<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-views</p>
<p>At least with the second approach, it is easier to have a clear idea of where to find classes on first opening them. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t however solve my problem of moving between server side and client logic and pausing for a moment before realising I am where I need to work. This is a first world problem for which I don&#8217;t believe there is a solution.</p>
