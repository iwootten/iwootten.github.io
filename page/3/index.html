<h1><a href="/2013/01/21/new-year-new-theme">New Year, New Theme</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">21 Jan 2013</div>
<p>I’ve long made use of the default theme on WordPress, which I’ve always felt wasn’t entirely “me”. The theme now live is one I’ve been tinkering with for a while now based on the lovely preview design used in the <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a> document editing tool for github. I really like the focus on simplicity and think it suits me well.</p>

<p>I’ve added some different styling for the navigation elements, given they didn’t already exist on <a href="http://prose.io">prose.io</a>. I’ve also added some subtle colour changes when navigating between pages, many of which are based on <a href="http://laurakalbag.com">Laura Kalbag</a>‘s palettes over on <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/lover/LJK">colour lovers</a>.</p>

<p>One of the things I hadn’t counted on was consolidating 10 years worth of blog posts into sensible categories as it was becoming a bit of a mess. When I first started blogging, wordpress didn’t exist, let alone tagging and I think I started out using categories in a manner to replicate them.</p>

<p>There’s still a few things I’m not entirely happy with, such as how navigation is represented for single posts. I intend to tidy the theme up and release it back to the WordPress community, but for now I’m enjoying having finally got it out in the open. Feel free to let me know what you think.</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/01/04/why-i-choose-popular-frameworks">Why I Choose Popular Frameworks</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">04 Jan 2013</div>
<p>I feel compelled to write this post so late in the day after clocking <a href="https://gist.github.com/4454814">Tyler Renelle’s rant</a> on github about his problems with the popularity of certain JS frameworks (in the main <a href="http://backbonejs.org">Backbone.js</a>). After having written apps in a variety of JS frameworks (Backbone, Spine and Meteor), I’ve learned that the feature set of a framework is not the only thing I hold dear when making a choice between them.</p>

<p>Documentation, support, learning curve and most importantly community are what also guide me when building anything. If I need to make an app quickly, I’ll of course develop it in my favourite tool (Backbone), because I’ve been using it for years and therefore doesn’t hold a cost. If I have a problem, I know there’s a ton of hackers who’ve probably already worked on solutions already and mechanisms are in place for them to offer advice. There may be better documented more capable tools, but I can’t foot the expense in the short term that might come with investigating something new and run the risk of hitting problems I can’t solve. In the long term, as a framework grows in popularity and garners these other factors then I may make that jump. </p>

<p>The real reason these frameworks are popular right now is in part because they are already popular.</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/01/02/2012">2012</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">02 Jan 2013</div>
<p>So here we are in a brand new year. 2012 came and went without even the slightest apocalypse. Reflecting on what has been achieved this past year has found favour with others in the web profession so I thought I might try it. More importantly to me, it also seems like a good way to perhaps spur me on to achieve some firm targets this year.</p>

<p>My circumstances have dramatically changed since January last year. I’ve gone from full time employment as a frontend/backend developer for Aardman to being self employed as a frontend developer for the majority of the year. This was (and still is) a scary leap. Finding work, managing finances whilst still trying to be a good father/husband is a sometimes difficult balancing act to perform. So far though (after 9 months and counting), I’m enjoying it.</p>

<h2 id="events">Events</h2>

<p>The amount of conferences/meetups that have been organised this side of the bridge has been fantastic, especially where I’ve not had such a long commute this year. I’ve been able to head along regularly but have had to be fairly choosy about the amount of events I can attend. It’s great to see such a blossoming community round here. I’ve also thought about organising my own event, though I think I have enough on my plate at the moment.</p>

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p>JS has been my bread and butter this year. I’ve enjoyed digging deeper into various frontend frameworks and learning as much as I can about the language. Where I’ve known relatively little about the ins and outs of other backend languages, I feel like I actually have something to contribute here. I’ve continued tinkering with node.js on the backend and have used it as a build tool for much of the year. I spent some time learning a little Cocoa shortly after leaving Aardman and taking the <a href="https://education.10gen.com/">MongoDB developer training course by 10gen</a>. Whilst I found it difficult fitting the course in around everything, I can highly recommend it. I’ve even developed a couple of things myself, which I hope to tidy up and release over the coming year. I’ve not been able to write a great deal about what I’m learning, but hope that will soon change. Some of my most popular posts here relate to use of CouchDB and node.js from many moons ago.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>I already had a number of side projects running before the start of last year but I’ve had a number of ideas for tools and a fairly major service I’d like to work on across 2012. I plan on releasing more details soon, but would love to have a recurring revenue stream from one of these coming in at some point this year. I find I can easily stray from this path and get distracted by other less fruitful ideas I have. I’m going to make it a resolution that I remain committed to one thing at a time, whilst putting to bed ideas that haven’t worked out.</p>

<h2 id="design">Design</h2>

<p>As much as I feel like I have adequate design chops, I’ve not had the opportunity to demonstrate them publicly. I’d love to redesign <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk">several</a> <a href="http://niftydigits.com">of my</a> <a href="http://fairandbare.com">sites</a> to a standard that I feel reflect my skills as a web craftsman. I’m currently working on developing a wordpress theme which I hope to contribute back to the community once I’m done.</p>

<p>So in all, it’s been a good, 2012. I’ve not fitted everything I might like in, but much of the content of my projects and work I had no idea about back at the start of last year. That also means you have something to look forward to from me in 2013. </p>

<p>Happy New Year everyone.</p>

<h1><a href="/2012/11/23/oh-crap-im-a-frontend-developer">Oh Crap, I&#8217;m a Frontend Developer</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">23 Nov 2012</div>
<p>When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000′s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites – that was it.</p>

<p>As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: “UX Designers” were the first to appear on the scene to me, and <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1596">we’re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails</a>. The one that particularly got my hair up though was a “Frontend Developer”. Basically, going from the skills that were listed with these roles (HTML, CSS, JS) it was a designer who could also do a bit of jQuery…. Not a real developer then. Not someone who pokes around with backend scripts and really knows what’s going on, right? Someone who can properly structure apps and create proper object oriented classes. It got my hair up because it seemed like an attempt to poach credentials from us hardworking devs. How dare they. Losers.</p>

<p>Time passed…. I got a real job….. The industry invented more job titles….</p>

<p>My first role was as a PHP/MySQL developer. I also started having to make decisions on frontend design and behaviour without having a formal education in either. I was, in my own projects at least, the only person to do such work. Outside of work during my first job, I decided to play with two hot technologies at the time: CouchDB and node.js. I geeked out about both, using document based stores and Javascript server-side – but hated the steep learning curve that came with having to use JS. It also missed many of the constructs I’d become used to in other languages.</p>

<p>I’d seen a great deal of realtime apps and knew behaviour in my own apps should be keeping up. What I had could be better, much better. It was about here I probably started appreciating how much work was involved in a typical browser based app. I started using <a href="http://backbonejs.org">backbone.js</a> with a view to better organising the mess of JS that typically sat next to my markup. There wasn’t a great deal of help around, so I read a book as an aide….. I had to properly approach what was going on in the browser as I would do any other software. Hmm, weird. JS in the browser had up until now, been an afterthought to “jazz stuff up”. Developing real, well designed software in the browser however really floated my boat. I prototyped a simple calendar app and it worked fantastically well.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been lucky enough to move into a full time contract role as a Javascript Developer – or a Frontend Web Developer, if you like. I probably would have been shocked had someone suggested this 5 or so years ago.</p>

<p>I’m really enjoying being part of the community around JS, the ever increasing list of libraries being posted and patterns for development. Hopefully I’ve learnt to be a little more discerning of job titles than I have been in the past.</p>

<h1><a href="/2012/11/20/essential-cinema-lovefilm">Essential Cinema According to Lovefilm</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">20 Nov 2012</div>
<p>Given there’s a bit of lovefilm bashing <a href="http://www.tomalloyd.com/lovefilm-hate-email/">going on in Wales</a> at the moment, I thought I’d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm. </p>

<p>Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I’ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lovefilm.com/emailpublic/cmsnewsletter/uk-newsletter/LOVEFiLM-Newsletter/2012/Newsletter-Issue-No-409?cid=lfnl409tlweb&#038;brand=lovefilm"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Read-Newsletter-Issue-409-5.jpg" alt="" title="Read Newsletter Issue 409 5" width="470" height="906" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-569" /></a></p>

<p>I really couldn’t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema’s to perform reviews and certainly don’t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image. </p>

<p>Also, the first thing I’m drawn to is the image. Why lead me away from the title of that movie and make work to find the text for the heading? Don’t make the title and preview exactly the same size, or divide them up!</p>

<p>End of rant.</p>

<h1><a href="/2012/09/04/recovering-images-from-sd-cards-with-photorec">Recovering Images from SD Cards with PhotoRec</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">04 Sep 2012</div>
<p>I had the horrible situation last Sunday following removing a number of pictures using an SD reader from my SD card that when I inserted it in my camera, it registered nothing upon it. My heart sunk, because this card is stuffed full of images of me and my family (along with my 1 year old son growing up) and I was unsure of which ones I’d actually backed up. After perusing the hidden files on the card, all I could discover was the files I’d most recently transferred from the card….great…</p>

<p>Partly this was my own fault – I’d already experienced problems with the reader in question when trying to write images for my <a href="http://raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> and shouldn’t have used it for transferring images I care about. The card in question is a uber cheapo <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Integral-USB-Single-Slot-Reader/dp/B000VY80AM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1346533453&#038;sr=8-1">Integral USB 2.0</a>. Despite what the amazon reviews say, steer well clear of it – this has been a pain from day one, with intermittent transfer problems which triggered this situation.</p>

<p>After a little more digging, I came across <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec">Photorec</a>, a commandline utility which seemed like it would hopefully help recover some of the images. I attempted to use it with my card reader, but given it’s credentials I’ve given above, found the scanning process would cut out and couldn’t get through the whole card. At this point the card was being reported empty….great…Given the way PhotoRec works, I understood it would still be possible to extract the images despite this. I decided to order another reader and hold fire until it had arrived – this time I opted for a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Kingston-Technology-Multi-Card-Reader/dp/B007PFQ0PC/">Kingston USB 3.0</a> (which I haven’t had any such problems with so far).</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>

<p>Here are the steps I followed after receiving my new sd reader to recover images from the card using PhotoRec. I’m listing them for anyone else who may have the same horrendous stomach wrenching problem I did last Sunday. It seems to have worked pretty well, with only 1 movie file coming out corrupted and about 500 images recovered.</p>

<p>Firstly, I wanted to take a copy of the card as it currently stood following my investigation. For this I used df, diskutil and ddrescue.</p>

<p>To determine where the card is currently mounted (look for the one that’s about the right size):</p>

<pre class="bash">df -h
</pre>

<p>To unmount the card so we can fiddle with it:</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo diskutil unmount /dev/disk1s1
</pre>

<p>To backup the card to a disk image on your macbook:</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo ddrescue /dev/disk1s1 ./sdbackup/image.img backuplog
</pre>

<p>Finally, using PhotoRec scan the disk image that was just created. My image was FAT formatted I scanned the whole thing rather than just unallocated blocks.</p>

<pre class="bash">sudo ./photorec ~/sdbackup/image.img
</pre>

<p>The final piece of this saga was to rename all the files PhotoRec created so they were in folders according to their exif data. My photos are all in folders like “2012_06_30″, so to have 500 files named “f0677440.jpg”, “f0688768.jpg” in a random PhotoRec directory would be pretty annoying. I had looked at setting up an automator task for this, but I ended up using <a href="http://www.petrosit.de/index.php/apps/12-pexiftool">PexifTool</a> for simplicities sake (I’m sure there are other alternatives). I believe if you go the Automator route, you may well have to install plugins in order to be able to extract exif data from files.</p>

<p>This is a talk I did back in May at <a href="http://unifieddiff.co.uk">unifieddiff</a> about my time working as a web developer at Aardman Features. I talk quite a bit about the production process and what we take from staff in order to help them do their jobs properly. I quite enjoyed giving this talk – more so than those I’ve given in an academic capacity in the past.</p>

<p>What are you doing? Why would you go down that road? Shouldn’t you be building something else? How long have you been doing this?</p>

<p>Sure you can fool your clients into thinking you’re adding value to their product. I know the truth. But how did you – with all your expertise get to the point in thinking that’s what you’re really doing?</p>

<p>This is your first project? Shouldn’t you be focusing on your clients problems? </p>

<p>Why are you busily building a framework, when you’re already overdue? You know there’s any flavour of ORM available already right? What’s wrong with you? Where are your requirements?</p>

<p>Do you think that you’re going to be able to produce something better than the thousands of contributors to that open source project you’re avoiding using? They’ve been doing it for years already, for thousands of use cases. You think somehow yours falls outside it’s catchment area? Seriously? How arrogant are you?</p>

<p>You’ve been blinkered into thinking you’re an expert in areas you’re not. When your time is spent solving the wrong problems and you’re not invited back, I hope you’ll realise that you’re nowhere near as good a hacker as you think.</p>

<div class="author_meta">03 May 2012</div>
<p>If my years in academia have taught me anything, it’s that insight obvious to you isn’t often obvious to others. </p>

<p>As a result, I’ve pretty much adopted a gung-ho hacker attitude towards getting my own ideas built whereby I’ll just often work to get an iteration of an site out as fast as possible. The only factor here is my own time and I’m in the fortunate position to have some of that available now and again. There’s a variety of reasons why I might attempt a project, ranging from it may later evolve into something able to draw an income further down the line, that I’m excited by learning from the tools I choose to use or that I feel moved enough by a problem to do something to try and prompt change. </p>

<p>I had one of these ideas last weekend, whereby I was wondering what the specifics of the fees of kickstarter projects broke down to. The information on what fees are taken is published <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/help/faq/creating%20a%20project#WhatFeesDoesKickChar" title="what fees does kickstarter charge">on their site</a>, so I set about a simple phantomjs script (available <a href="https://github.com/niftydigits/kickstarter.js">on github</a>) that could scrape the information from kickstarter. After doing so, the idea moved on to graphing said information via an app to a simple raphaeljs and again further once I’d realised some other stats that could be gathered from the info I was grabbing. The end result is <a href="http://starterstats.com">Starter Stats</a> – which is, (I think) a neat little site for showing stats on any kickstarter project.</p>

<p><a href="http://starterstats.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-Shot-2012-05-03-at-10.16.42-1024x817.png" alt="" title="Starter Stats" width="640" height="510" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-536" /></a></p>

<p>It took a little longer than I’d hoped, but I’m really pleased with the final site as it stands. You should also be able to just replace the beginning of any kickstarter project page (http://kickstarter.com) with “http://starterstats.com” and you’ll be sent to the relevant stats page on the app. Pages are generated on-demand every 15 minutes. Go on, take a look and let me know what you think.</p>

<p>I could have not spent my time on this, instead kicking back and waiting for someone else to build such a tool. But I couldn’t see that happening. No, better for me to build, learn whilst doing so and move on to my next project. What do you get by not building?</p>
