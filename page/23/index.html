        I forgot to write a classic quote I found in &#8216;Boy&#8217; while I was away so I thought I&#8217;d shove it up now. I think it encompasses how I feel about work at the moment. Really enjoyed just lazing about reading in France for ages, finished Pi, although I found it to drag on somewhat, the quirky bit at the end made it fairly clever. Onto some Pratchett now after resisiting for ages.

        Our last day in Jard was rather less exciting than we&#8217;d hoped, we decided to clean the place* we were staying in, so spent the morning doing that and unfortunately the weather was cack so didn&#8217;t make for much of an afternoon either. We apparently caught the back end of a heatwave this week which has been rather fortunate, although pretty uncomfortable in the evenings. (Tim had it worse being in the same room as Mr &#8216;Exorcist&#8217; Pete, I had to endure that in Germany so it&#8217;s his turn this time).

        Yesterday not a lot happened, except for much reading and bumming around the house whilst trying out my newly found juggling skills. We also went on our search for pastis, after discovering that it actually tasted much the same as oizo, a wicked aniseed flavour&#8230;I think Rach may need to be educated in its use however, due to filling a wine glass neat with the stuff, which I would of been dead if I&#8217;d actually consumed undiluted, or at least extremely quiet for the rest of the evening.

        Decided to make a move on to our next beach today, taking with us a picnic and a load of beer. This one is situated right next to a forest, which was ace for our picnic.
Tim, after 3 years of living with one another has finally managed to teach me to juggle and give me the bug for continuing it. It&#8217;s actually easier to learn using boule, forcing you to use correct arm movements, though its a little dangerous on the beach if you have a distinct lack of footwear.

        Today we went over to the salt marshes in Olonne, it being slightly more manageable weather and all. Tim basically wanted to do a little birdwatching and Heledd and Dave didn&#8217;t fancy such french beauty so went to have coffee in a suitable village somewhere. It was really cool, took lots of photos of the strange green murky waters and had a bunch of exercise too. Saw loads of eels while we were there &#8211; horrible things writhing about&#8230;.

        Sunday&#8217;s morning events weren&#8217;t overly exciting &#8211; the weather has been so hot that it would be a bit much to go off and try to do anything. Instead has been a morning of reading (Dahl&#8217;s &#8216;Boy&#8217; &#8211; bizzarrely featuring Cardiff, La Rochelle and Somerset within) and people trying to juggle. The afternoon became overcast so we decided to make the trip down to the beach, where Tim, Rach and Pete all got rather dirty trying to recreate a eurotunnel experience, which was destroyed as soon as it was completed by Dave.

        So, it begins, the holiday season that is and with it my two day trip across England and back down the west coast of France to Jard Su Mer. Todays trip was fairly long, spending two hours bombing down the M4 to meet with the guys in Reading, then a further few to reach the underside of London on the M25, and a bit more to finally bundle over toward the Eurotunnel.

        You&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that the title might refer to Pop&#8217;s funeral this week, but no, I mean the fact that finally after 7 years in courtship Mike and Jo have become hitched. Thats strike 5 from the core Yeovil lad&#8217;s posse&#8230;
It was a fab day, with schoolfriends from yesteryear I haven&#8217;t kept up to date with, and family members I never knew existed. My sister always seems to find it amusing that Jo&#8217;s sis, Sarah got hitched before them being a couple of years younger, having her been to school with Sarah and Jo in my form.

        No, not the monthly breaks event in Clwb Ifor, though you&#8217;d be forgiven for thinking that&#8217;s what this post would be about due to regular raving about it, no, *actual *Sumo.
So I started my trip off at 9:45am &#8211; realising that actually that Tesco&#8217;s would be shut if I left earlier and I&#8217;d not get fuel.. After faffing getting burgers and the like, I set off about 10:20am to Bournemouth.
