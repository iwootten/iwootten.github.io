        So, I’ve had not a lot of response to my situation with ebuyer of late, but this recent email I recieved from them sent me over the edge – I’d sent them 7 emails and phoned 2 times with a 40 min wait prior to recieving this.

        I went round to Living Stones last night for a bit of a lads night with Jon, Dan, Rob and Joe for music and watching Batman Begins. I took a number of Cd’s for Dan and I to listen to, which basically reflected the “base” around which the majority of all my other music stems from. It’s quite odd trying to verbalise how a particular song makes you feel, why you feel uplifted by it, how it captures a particular moment in time, thought, etc etc.

        I’ve been attending a fair few ‘live’ gigs recently as oppose to the frequenting of clubs in Cardiff. The first was the fantastic Röyksopp, whom I was dubious to see alone, but glad I did. Quite frankly they were as great live as I could possibly hope for and the addition of the huge inflatable tape and scrolling info about each song added to the experience.
More recently, I got to see “Bowling for Soup” at union on Friday, which allowed me to experience the ‘delights’ of teen punk as well as some awful “post-punk laptop (c)rap” from Mc Lars who seemed confused as to where exactly Cardiff featured in the UK.

        I found a wicked animation by Maria Claudia Cortes describing what personalities a bunch of colours are often attributed with. I reckon I’m a mixture of red and blue, my wardrobe reflects this as well. What colour are you?

        Whats the most annoying thing ebuyer could leave out of my order for my building a new PC? That’s it – the OS, so I can build my lovely little machine, but not actually use the thing until they get their act together. Nice one guys, you suck ass.

        I’ve always bought lots of music. Those of you who’ve had the privilege of viewing my collection will have seen it spans all manner of media, Tape, CD, MD, Vinyl. I’ve recently been doing a lot of random browsing on ebay for CD’s that have previously escaped me and possibly buying a few other items from the same seller to save on postage. My biggest one though has to be my most recent, 12 albums from the same seller.

        I’m feeling rather fragile at the moment, which is really annoying because the majority of the time I’m the picture of health. It started yesterday, but I thought I’d got over it only for headaches and tummy aches to return by the evening. Unfortunately, it meant I wasn’t best of hosts to Hannah who stayed over on Sunday because of a stereophonics gig she was going to. I had to fix her up with Jon to go with as her mate decided to back out on her pretty late.

        That last post aside heres a mildly amusing anecdote that happened to me whilst in B�Q a couple of weeks ago featuring a sweet old welsh lady.
Old Lady (Looking at lampshades): “Is that the ACTUAL price of these!?”
Me (Bewildered, wondering past end of aisle): “Well, yeah, it says so on the label”
Old Lady: “£11.99! I saw ‘em for £1 on Newport Road!”
Me (Still bewildered, now in aisle): “Oh.

        I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don’t think is interesting at all, but I’ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others.

        Some of you may have noticed that I’ve moved. Whats that? You didn’t? Oh well, cheers then, how much of a friend are you? I never read your blog either. For those who didn’t – take a look in the address bar, I’m now at www.ianwootten.co.uk (Highly original I know!).
This week I have been mostly stressing about work, sitting at home alone, watching repeats, finding interesting links through the wonder of del.
