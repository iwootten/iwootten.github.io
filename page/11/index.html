<p>Did you not know? I’m going to hit the grand old age of 26 soon. Whooah, thats like ancient. If you want some ideas of what you can get me (I obviously expect a gift), why not check my gift list <a href="http://gifttagging.com/scrumpyjack">here</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2ZGQU6TDBXOYL/203-4356029-7279932">here</a>, to save the embarrasment of some really awful gift.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/02/20/here-comes-the-fuzz">Here comes the Fuzz</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">20 Feb 2007</div>
<p>Tonight, Cineworld gave us tickets free to any film of our choice when we were meant to be seeing a preview, due to a cock up at their end. I already knew what it would be without looking at what was out, Hot Fuzz. </p>

<p>I’ve loved Simon Pegg ever since the days of Big Train, when humour was just so completely random it had to be funny. Shaun of the Dead had some great random moments in it, but I left it feeling that it wasn’t the best I’d come to expect. Hot Fuzz however is a great take on an altogether different genre, although you might not be able to tell from the gore levels it dishes out. Apparently it was filmed in Wells in Somerset, which actually is the smallest city in England and my home county. The uniforms they wore confused the locals who thought they were real policemen. Obviously nobody watches spoof zombie movies down there except me and a few others. If you’re looking for an action-packed bloody comedy, get down to your local cinema already.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="http://hotdealsuk.com">hotdealsuk</a> prior to christmas and I think its an absolute must for any techie thats currently residing in the uk. Basically, a sophisticated messageboard, bargains of interest to the community are highlighted and then voted upon. Those more highly voted make it through to the front page.</p>
<p>I absolutely love it and so far have managed to purchase 1 xbox (with 4 games) @ £50 and a <a href="http://www.maplin.co.uk/Module.aspx?ModuleNo=48872&#038;TabID=1&#038;source=1&#038;doy=24m1">400Gb harddrive @ £83</a>. Introducing a friend to it this evening meant he was able to purchase an <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Accurist-MB608N-Stainless-Chronograph-Bracelet/dp/B000M4PTIM/ref=br_lf_m__1_1_img/026-8583712-3082010?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&#038;s=electronics">accurist watch</a> for £31 rather than its usual £95 price tag.</p>

<p>Richmond road in Cardiff today is pretty much like a river all the way down today, due to all the horrid weather hitting it, resulting in the following set of footprints (post cycling to work) around my office.</p>

<h1><a href="/2007/01/16/why-cant-every-day-be-a-holiday">Why can&#8217;t every day be a holiday?</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">16 Jan 2007</div>
<p>I had a some great times away on holidays recently. The first was at New Year in Rhayader with the usual suspects getting absolutely soaked and vowing never to let anyone else plan a walk ever again. It was good to get outside away from these pesky machines.</p>

<center>
  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/imw/344314802/" title="Viv Pretends She's Happy"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/149/344314802_3970e9270c_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="new years 07 017" /></a>
</center>

<p>As if that wasn’t enough, I went away to France to the slightly more exciting Alps for a skiing holiday for a week too. This was with Viv’s medic mates and spouses and future spouses. We were enrolled into a french ski school for the entire week, going from being complete liabilities to competent skiers on the funny bits of wood. </p>

<p>Viv and I were both enrolled at a slightly faster pace originally, but after my frustration of being at the back of the class for an entire lesson, playing constant catch up, thorough humiliation and Viv’s tiredness (she says) we decided to drop down with the majority of the rest of our group to the complete beginners group. I’d rather go and enjoy the experience at a comfortable pace than annoy everyone by being angry. Anyway, its not like I’m not a beginner.</p>

<p>By the last day, we were comfortable with getting chair and button lifts here there and everywhere and getting down the majority of the mountain without any further coaching, albeit on the beginner runs. I have a single scratch and bruise from the whole week, which is much better than some of the casualities I saw being loaded onto the aeroplane in Chambery. At some points however, I was extemely glad I knew I had travel insurance for my time there, like a straight run heading to a lowered car park with no feasible means of being able to stop (it somehow happened though), or realising what I seemed to be heading at some speed over had turned into jumps.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for the very exciting photos.</p>
