<span class=item__date>May 30, 2008</span>
I’m not sure how many visitors have caught this ted talk before, but I’d thought I’d post it anyway. Johnny Chung Lee is amazing, turning a $40 wii remote into use an interactive whiteboard or a new way to interact with video games via head tracking. He’s been at this sort of thing for ages previously putting out a $14 steadycam.</div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/05/06/fair-and-bare-bringing-design-to-fairtrade/>Fair and Bare - Bringing Design to Fairtrade</a></span>
<span class=item__date>May 06, 2008</span>
Some of the visitors to this site might be aware that I like my t shirts, each with their bold and awesome illustrations. I’m also quite an avid supporter of fairtrade, being involved with fairdos and purchasing fairtrade options such as tea and chocolate where possible. One of the big bugbears my friends and I have always had in the support of the fairtrade movement is that many of the designs put across upon fairtrade cotton products don’t appeal to us at all.

<span class=item__date>Apr 02, 2008</span>
One of the things that’s bugged me for a while whilst having a website is that at certain times of the year when people might actually like to buy me a gift they’re unable to find my wishlist. This is mainly because they’re simple folk who might not think to check amazon for my name. I’m also signed up with amazon associates, so I decided it could do me well to post my wishlist items along with my referral tag in the links in order to earn a bob or two on my own homepage.

<span class=item__date>Jan 30, 2008</span>
One of the most frustrating things I find about hearing about possible web development jobs on certain sites is the sheer amount of them which are simply unviable due to my UK location. Previously I decided to post all those jobs I could find to my own webtyrant site and the recent job and profile sites in the django communities has got me thinking about how these two pieces of information on locality could be aggregated together (I don’t have time myself to do this though unfortunately – perhaps someone might like to chat about collaborating).

<span class=item__date>Jan 05, 2008</span>
One of the most frustrating things I find in managing a number of websites is that I’m always forgetting passwords. The version of Filezilla I’m running however makes it easy to remember them again through its use of weak XOR encryption and a the key being hard coded into the software. I’ve used a program previously called the Filezilla Password Recover, but it turns out that this is also extremely easy to extract them using a simple PHP script.

<span class=item__date>Dec 20, 2007</span>
I’m a firm believer that by upholding my own principles, I’ll be rewarded. It’s a tag line I adopted for the small hosting company that I’ve been running for a while now. It also has been reflected this year in a nasty situation I was left in with my landlords, the council and a previous housemate (who doesn’t really deserve that title, more just a person whom shared the house). In all these situations things have turned out better for me in the long run, due to myself re-enforcing what I believe should be done – even if it does mean a longer struggle through.

The Cardiff geeks will be having its first ever face to face on Wednesday 17th October from 7pm at Cafe Floyd, just opposite the castle. Props to Dan Zambonini for organising the venue.
This is an informal, introduction between us all. If you’re a geek, or interested in chatting with us about what we and you are passionate about, make sure you get over there!</div><div class=post-list__item><span class=item__title--big><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2007/09/20/undeserved-job-titles/>Undeserved Job Titles</a></span>
<span class=item__date>Sep 20, 2007</span>
Today on the return from uni I passed the new Subway that is opening up soon near Queen Street train station. On one of their job adverts, they were advertising for team leaders and sandwich artists. I’ve never really noticed my sandwiches being arranged in a artistic fashion before, maybe it would brighten my day if they were. I feel sorry for the poor art school graduate who ends up filling baguettes for a living.
