      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2009</div>

          <p>In order for me to generate this post I&#8217;ve created something quite novel on my blog &#8211; a new category which I&#8217;ve not had a great deal of experience in previously, &#8220;work&#8221;. For the last couple of months I&#8217;ve been working for <a href="http://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a> features in Bristol on their forthcoming feature film, &#8220;Pirates&#8221; &#8211; building software, which I&#8217;ll be doing at least for the next couple of months too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having an amazing experience over this time. Being landed in a fantastic position of working with extremely talented, creative individuals &#8211; whom have worked on tons of entertainment that I&#8217;ve chuckled away too throughout my life. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have been sent to LA in order to read up and fully understand the software I&#8217;m working on too and also get to see many exciting elements of the production process. The nature of the work I&#8217;m doing has meant I&#8217;ve had to talk to everyone from the floor crew, model making, camera assistants and animators to visual effects and editorial. It has been a massive task to take in the huge amount of new information, but I am loving learning about every step in the process. It&#8217;s great to see all these steps under one roof working as a massive family unit.</p>
<p>The whole experience is to say the least exciting and quite honestly I am honoured to be involved with it! Here&#8217;s to the next couple of months&#8230;.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/05/16/create-your-own-tinyurl-service-for-wordpress">Create Your Own TinyURL Service for WordPress</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">16 May 2009</div>

          <p>I don&#8217;t particularly like using URL shortening services. I think I first noticed them getting used rather prolificly in the Guardians technology section to include lots of random links to bizarre web content. <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL&#8217;s own web site</a> wouldn&#8217;t particularly inspire me to go ahead and make use of it either. But, because of <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">my own use</a> of services such as twitter, I&#8217;m forced to shrink down links to get within those 144 characters.</p>
<p>Herein lies a problem &#8211; If said URL shortening service disappears, all my links are broken to all that interesting content I worked so hard to find. Not good.</p>
<p>In order to our bit to help, <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">a</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/?start=10">number</a> <a href="http://www.colly.com/comments/ee_shortener_plugin_your_own_short_urls_using_revcanonical_and_permanent_re/">of</a> <a href="http://bokardo.com/">developers</a> and even <a href="http://baconfile.com/">services</a> have taken action in order to make sure they provide alternatives for the links over which they&#8217;re responsible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://whomwah.com/2009/04/14/revcanonical-a-revcanonical-wordpress-plugin/">installed a plugin here</a> which uses the recently puchased domain &#8220;<a href="http://woot10.eu">woot10.eu</a>&#8221; to provide alternative links using the code <code>&lt;link rev=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;shorter link&quot; /&gt;</code>. My full ianwootten.co.uk domain does not lend itself well to be able to provide a shorter URL on the same domain unforunately.</p>
<p>There is a whole huge discussion on the approriateness of using this technique (mainly) due to the rev attribute not being included in the HTML5 spec. See the comments in <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/save-the-internet-with-rev-canonical">Chris Shifletts post</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>Anyway, Duncans plugin takes the id of any wordpress post and coverts it to base 36 (instead of 10) and offers up the alternative in the header of each post. I believe the conversion could go all the way up to 62, if php&#8217;s base conversion actually supported the use of different cases in conversion.</p>
<p>In my own case, I&#8217;ve had to forward the links from woot10.eu across to www.ianwootten.co.uk using a .htaccess file so that the plugin is actually able to pick them up.</p>
<p>Now when you visit:</p>
<p><code>http://woot10.eu/p8p</code> you&#8217;ll be forwarded on to the longer URL such as <code>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/05/15/my-vicious-circle-of-posting-quality-content</code>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t particularly useful if you want to find the alternative for URL, as you&#8217;ll have to hunt through the source of a post. For that I&#8217;d suggest <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">Simons bookmarklet</a> which looks for an alternative link, or creates one if it doesn&#8217;t exist using tinyurl. As an aside, there looks to be an interesting talk on the canonical attribute and link element by Matt Cutts of google <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm9onOGTgeM">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 May 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been looking back at the posts on this site and the commitment that I supposedly made (internally) a couple of months ago about posting regular, interesting content. But it seemed to die a death very promptly.</p>
<p>I think that there may be a bit of a vicious circle here (in my own situation at least). I&#8217;d love to post regular interesting stuff, but for that to happen I need to feel that it might be read. By far the most commented stuff here is when I link up code. Those posts take a fairly substantial amount of time for me to complete as they are born of the result of my own frustration of hours spent tinkering with code, which I think might be useful for others to be clued up on. I also need time to gather my thoughts and structure what exactly I&#8217;m trying to say to people. This all adds up.</p>
<p>If I post more often, I fear the lesser quality of content might be pretty boring for the majority of people and probably not at all worthy of feedback from them. So I end up in a kind of stalemate position &#8211; should I post this/shouldn&#8217;t I/Oo-er and I don&#8217;t do anything. I&#8217;m not saying that I have a massive amount of visitors here, I&#8217;d just like them to enjoy the experience when they visit.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/02/15/how-has-web-use-changed-your-life">How has web use changed your life?</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">15 Feb 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been pondering this morning how the use of the internet has (or may have) changed my life. As a child/teen during the web&#8217;s infancy, I was blissfully unaware that so many lifes/careers/relationships would be enabled or changed as a result of the interactions it might facilitate. I hadn&#8217;t even heard of google prior to arriving at university and two years prior to that had never had internet access anywhere locally.<br>I am sure my behaviour today would be pretty different if the web wasn&#8217;t around due to the massive impact its had in my world view. It seems a far smaller place and more tightly coupled. I feel free to drop messages to strangers and write blog posts into the ether. I won a T4 competition in my early uni years which landed me a car and £4k richer, which I wouldn&#8217;t have entered if I&#8217;d had to phone &#8211; so I&#8217;d definitely be poorer. There are however, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6187554.stm">examples</a> where the use of the web has had a detrimental effect on particular individual lives.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a huge one to think about. Would my life be better as a result of the web having not been so widely adopted in the way it has? Would yours?</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Feb 2009</div>

          <p><a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> is all over the news at the moment. For the uninitiated, it allows you to list short updates of what you are doing at any time. BBC News seemed to have an all-out assault at the end of January raving about it at every opportunity &#8211; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7834755.stm">the first moments of the Hudson plane landing</a>, an short chat about it by Stephen Fry on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7845823.stm">this short clip on iPlayer</a> by <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/blog/2009/01/29/twitter/">Stephen Fry again</a>. For Stephen Fry, this has meant an insane amount of new followers, indicated by the stats by twittercounter, which are shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://twittercounter.com/stephenfry/month"><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/stephenfry-twitcount-300x236.gif" alt="Stephenfry&#039;s Twittercounter" title="Stephenfry Twittercounter" width="300" height="236" class="size-medium wp-image-302" /></a></p>
<p>Notice the stats for 27th January &#8211; a full 20,978 extra followers in a single day! My <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">own profile</a> has a paltry 38 in comparison for all time!, which is about 30 more friends than I actually have offline&#8230;</p>
<p>I guess this huge upsurge is in part due to the fact that Stephen is such a well known comedian in the UK and by no means a stranger to the web. Just yesterday <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/02/stephen-fry-stuck-in-elevator-twittering">Jason Kottke observed his day as deciding &#8220;to start his own reality chat show after becoming stuck in an elevator&#8221;</a>. He also has an <a href="http://stephenfry.com">awesome blog</a> and <a href="http://www.stephenfry.com/media/audio/109/series-2-episode-3--language/">podcast</a>. He also is a very open advocate of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/fry/happy-birthday-to-gnu.html">open source</a> and free software. How on earth he finds the time to live both his life virtually and as television celebrity I do not know. But I like the cut of his jib.</p>
<p>It seems micro-blogging is truly being picked up by the masses. I really enjoy it, but ideally I&#8217;d love to be using a decentralised open source service, hosted on my own personal webspace. I&#8217;d like to suggest the Open Micro Blogging service, <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> as the way forward &#8211; but then I also want to be able to reply to my friends on twitter and them to me and I don&#8217;t think true two way cross network chat will happen for a while. I see <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> to <a href="http://blogger.com">blogger</a> as <a href="http://laconi.ca">laconi.ca</a> is to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a>. I&#8217;m actually surprised that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be a concerted effort from any one of the current big blog companies right now to push for a more open alternative. The automatticians have put out <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">prologue</a> but it doesn&#8217;t seem to have been touched for over a year and only supports sharing amongst groups (as in a working environment)&#8230;that&#8217;s no fun for the rest of us.</p>
<p>Bring on a true open web status service, (complete with adopters) where I can update any one of my friends on my activities by them following a status feed on my homepage and vice versa. This requires clients who make use of such services though and right now twitter is stronger in that regard.</p>
