          <p>I&#8217;ve just updated my amazon associates plugin to take into account the recent signiture changes which amazon have introduced for their webservices api.</p>
<p>This now also means you&#8217;ll have to enter your amazon secret access key in the plugin configuration page.</p>
<p>You can download the updated version over <a href="http://ianwootten.co.uk/downloads/wishlist.zip">here</a>.</p>
<p>It also means <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wishlist">my wishlist</a> has finally been brought back to life. Just in time for Christmas&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">25 Oct 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve recently read a post over on the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/oct/23/internet-40-history-arpanet">guardians technology site</a> which gave a whistle-stop history of the internet as it turns 40. I thought I&#8217;d share here my own experiences of growing up alongside the web, more for my own record than anything.</p>
<p>I remember at school a time at which there was no external connection, nor internal network (which we the pupils used) so the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Network_Computer">Acorn machines</a> used at our school at the time could communicate with one another. Computers, for me at that point were standalone. I had as much of an interest in computing then as I do now and I can remember early on, staying around after school to use one of the only PC&#8217;s in the school (which was bought to run a piece of career piece software called Kudos), in order to attempt to run the demo games from cds found on pc mags at the time (the only one I can remember was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104692/">lawnmower man</a> demo). I did this until ofter one time a friend and I accidentally removing the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOEXEC.BAT">autoexec.bat</a> file which I hadn&#8217;t backed up&#8230;..oopsy</p>
<p><img src="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/riscosoldlook-300x225.gif" alt="RiscOS. Old School. Literally. Taken from toastytech.com" title="riscosoldlook" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-350" /></p>
<p>I of course had to stick around at school because we didn&#8217;t have our own pc at home, because they were very, very expensive (When we did finally get one, it was a Crappard Bell 486 DX2 66, 4 MB of RAM, 400MB HD and was over £1000). I felt a little jealous of my friends who both had PC&#8217;s and were able to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encarta">Microsoft&#8217;s Encarta</a> to help them out with their homework at that time. (Interestingly Encarta later also became a <a href="http://uk.encarta.msn.com/">website</a> and is to be discontinued later this week).</p>
<p>Bizarrely, I&#8217;d opted for A-Levels at 6th Form which didn&#8217;t allow me to experiment with pc&#8217;s much, not that it would have mattered as although the rest of the world was transitioning toward them, the <a href="http://www.gryphon.dorset.sch.uk/">Gryphon school</a> I attended had a whole computing lab full of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiscPC">RiscPC</a>&#8216;s. I think I went there once in the two years of A-Levels I did and kept my nose upturned whilst I was there.</p>
<p>Some point over this time, I&#8217;d also got hooked on a magazine called <a href="http://www.pcformat.co.uk/">PC Format</a> since the latter years of school, which allowed me to get all the games demos I wanted without spending however many years (and £&#8217;s) it would have taken to download them all. (I kept all 4 years worth of magazines I&#8217;d bought and cds/dvds right up unto moving in with my wife). At home, even though we were now in the year 1999, my parents hadn&#8217;t yet opted to purchase a dial-up modem and make that leap online. I was of course, still jealous of those mates &#8211; who now were connected. I got myself a hotmail account, where I eagerly awaited emails from no-one.</p>
<p>I can remember going to college and being scared about the prospect of doing a computing course but never having had any prior experience of using the web. My parents finally got a modem that year, but I still used to use the computing labs after teaching. I could download 1MB samples of music from <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk">Juno records</a> much more quickly over the leased line than I ever could waiting on the 56Kbps dialup at home. I also began working at <a href="http://www.dixons.co.uk/">Dixons</a> (for my sins), getting paid a pittance to talk to many clueless customers about &#8220;stereos&#8221;, &#8220;cd players&#8221; and &#8220;N64&#8242;s&#8221;. Working at Dixons did at least afford me the opportunity to experience playing Quake in Yeovils one and only internet cafe on a LAN against my friends and the staff that worked there. </p>
<p>My LAN parties moved to the computing labs at the university, outside of working hours (because as their 10 year old posters claim, you&#8217;re not allowed to use games on them during working hours&#8230;). Over several years of using the web, I&#8217;d never once heard of Google until it was mentioned by one of the research students taking our internet computing lectures. &#8220;You&#8217;ve probably heard of this&#8221; he said. &#8220;Er, no&#8221;, I thought &#8211; why did no-one tell me? I&#8217;d used a number of search engines such as <a href="http://www.lycos.co.uk/">lycos</a> and later <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">webcrawler</a>, but all were pretty awful in terms of giving me what I wanted &#8211; results. Instead they seemed content with a ridiculous number of adverts and making me hunt through a huge number of pages. Their pages now seem to indicate a new direction. </p>
<p>A bit of a trip down memory lane, but that&#8217;s how I ended up being introduced to Google. How about you?</p>

      <div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2009</div>

          <p>In order for me to generate this post I&#8217;ve created something quite novel on my blog &#8211; a new category which I&#8217;ve not had a great deal of experience in previously, &#8220;work&#8221;. For the last couple of months I&#8217;ve been working for <a href="http://www.aardman.com/">Aardman</a> features in Bristol on their forthcoming feature film, &#8220;Pirates&#8221; &#8211; building software, which I&#8217;ll be doing at least for the next couple of months too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been having an amazing experience over this time. Being landed in a fantastic position of working with extremely talented, creative individuals &#8211; whom have worked on tons of entertainment that I&#8217;ve chuckled away too throughout my life. I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have been sent to LA in order to read up and fully understand the software I&#8217;m working on too and also get to see many exciting elements of the production process. The nature of the work I&#8217;m doing has meant I&#8217;ve had to talk to everyone from the floor crew, model making, camera assistants and animators to visual effects and editorial. It has been a massive task to take in the huge amount of new information, but I am loving learning about every step in the process. It&#8217;s great to see all these steps under one roof working as a massive family unit.</p>
<p>The whole experience is to say the least exciting and quite honestly I am honoured to be involved with it! Here&#8217;s to the next couple of months&#8230;.</p>

          <h1><a href="/2009/05/16/create-your-own-tinyurl-service-for-wordpress">Create Your Own TinyURL Service for WordPress</a></h1>
      <div class="author_meta">16 May 2009</div>

          <p>I don&#8217;t particularly like using URL shortening services. I think I first noticed them getting used rather prolificly in the Guardians technology section to include lots of random links to bizarre web content. <a href="http://tinyurl.com">TinyURL&#8217;s own web site</a> wouldn&#8217;t particularly inspire me to go ahead and make use of it either. But, because of <a href="http://twitter.com/ironyboy">my own use</a> of services such as twitter, I&#8217;m forced to shrink down links to get within those 144 characters.</p>
<p>Herein lies a problem &#8211; If said URL shortening service disappears, all my links are broken to all that interesting content I worked so hard to find. Not good.</p>
<p>In order to our bit to help, <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">a</a> <a href="http://adactio.com/journal/?start=10">number</a> <a href="http://www.colly.com/comments/ee_shortener_plugin_your_own_short_urls_using_revcanonical_and_permanent_re/">of</a> <a href="http://bokardo.com/">developers</a> and even <a href="http://baconfile.com/">services</a> have taken action in order to make sure they provide alternatives for the links over which they&#8217;re responsible.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://whomwah.com/2009/04/14/revcanonical-a-revcanonical-wordpress-plugin/">installed a plugin here</a> which uses the recently puchased domain &#8220;<a href="http://woot10.eu">woot10.eu</a>&#8221; to provide alternative links using the code <code>&lt;link rev=&quot;canonical&quot; href=&quot;shorter link&quot; /&gt;</code>. My full ianwootten.co.uk domain does not lend itself well to be able to provide a shorter URL on the same domain unforunately.</p>
<p>There is a whole huge discussion on the approriateness of using this technique (mainly) due to the rev attribute not being included in the HTML5 spec. See the comments in <a href="http://shiflett.org/blog/2009/apr/save-the-internet-with-rev-canonical">Chris Shifletts post</a> for more on this.</p>
<p>Anyway, Duncans plugin takes the id of any wordpress post and coverts it to base 36 (instead of 10) and offers up the alternative in the header of each post. I believe the conversion could go all the way up to 62, if php&#8217;s base conversion actually supported the use of different cases in conversion.</p>
<p>In my own case, I&#8217;ve had to forward the links from woot10.eu across to www.ianwootten.co.uk using a .htaccess file so that the plugin is actually able to pick them up.</p>
<p>Now when you visit:</p>
<p><code>http://woot10.eu/p8p</code> you&#8217;ll be forwarded on to the longer URL such as <code>http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2009/05/15/my-vicious-circle-of-posting-quality-content</code>.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t particularly useful if you want to find the alternative for URL, as you&#8217;ll have to hunt through the source of a post. For that I&#8217;d suggest <a href="http://simonwillison.net/2009/Apr/11/revcanonical/">Simons bookmarklet</a> which looks for an alternative link, or creates one if it doesn&#8217;t exist using tinyurl. As an aside, there looks to be an interesting talk on the canonical attribute and link element by Matt Cutts of google <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm9onOGTgeM">here</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 May 2009</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been looking back at the posts on this site and the commitment that I supposedly made (internally) a couple of months ago about posting regular, interesting content. But it seemed to die a death very promptly.</p>
<p>I think that there may be a bit of a vicious circle here (in my own situation at least). I&#8217;d love to post regular interesting stuff, but for that to happen I need to feel that it might be read. By far the most commented stuff here is when I link up code. Those posts take a fairly substantial amount of time for me to complete as they are born of the result of my own frustration of hours spent tinkering with code, which I think might be useful for others to be clued up on. I also need time to gather my thoughts and structure what exactly I&#8217;m trying to say to people. This all adds up.</p>
<p>If I post more often, I fear the lesser quality of content might be pretty boring for the majority of people and probably not at all worthy of feedback from them. So I end up in a kind of stalemate position &#8211; should I post this/shouldn&#8217;t I/Oo-er and I don&#8217;t do anything. I&#8217;m not saying that I have a massive amount of visitors here, I&#8217;d just like them to enjoy the experience when they visit.</p>
