<div class="author_meta">17 Mar 2006</div>
<p>A few weeks ago, I noticed that worpdress.com, org and net weren’t registered, despite their similarity to the excellent blogging tool wordpress’s <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="wordpress.org">domain</a>. I thought it was too good an opportunity to be missed, and registered the lot of them.After a couple of posts on the wordpress forums, and the realisation that there was no way in hell I’d ever have the time to put anything there, I decided to donate them to Matt Mullenweg, so at least they were redirecting the one or two people who might hit them to the correct wordpress site.I sent a short email to Matt, whom I didn’t actually expect to reply – but to my surprise he did, and after a bit of searching round on godaddy for domain transferal technique (rather than re-registration), successfully switched them to his command. I hope they are of use to the person whom is technically this sites creator.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/03/06/digg-it">Digg It</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">06 Mar 2006</div>
<p>I’ve recently, through many searches to do with AJAX, Web 2.0 and the like been perusing <a href="http://digg.com">digg.com</a>, that fairly new web site for geeks.Basically, it’s a social booking marking site where users “digg” those sites which they find interesting, as more users digg the same pages, they get promoted up through to the main page, or higher up through the rankings within particular categories. Its a really interesting concept, quite similar to <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, but mainly centred on techie news, which means I end up reading it forever.The best part I think though is the <a href="http://digg.com/spy">digg spy</a> – which allows you to see (through a fancy ajax system) which diggs are being made right now.As an example of interesting links I’ve found, check out <a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=233460">these insanely realistic renders</a> of various interiors.</p>

<p>Flipping pancakes eh? They’re crafty beggars they are..</p>

<p>Would you believe that in my 24 years knocking around, I’d never actually flipped a pancake until this tuesday? You could understand why I might be a little excited about that particular prospect, and a little nervous. I spent my evening with a bunch of girls, in all shapes and sizes (some tall, some short, some insanely strong) to celebrate this occasion, but when my time to shine came, it was all good. </p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has ever tried to juggle pancakes between two frying pans and three pancakes…could be interesting?</p>

<p>I’ve started a new blog over at <a href="http://www.webtyrant.com">webtyrant.com</a> for all of you who visit my site and need a fix of techie-type jazz. I figured most of you didn’t, hence my placement on a different domain. You might notice a similar theme over there, so that’ll make you feel right at home even if the content doesn’t.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/02/09/hardware">MSI RS480M2-IL Motherboard</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">09 Feb 2006</div>
<p>For those of you who would like to have a stable SFF machine, lest ye take heed of my advice…do not buy MSI.I bought a mATX MSI RS480M2-IL back in october, with a view to putting it in my new Antec Aria SFF case. It looked deceptively feature packed with its 939 madness and 3 x PCI and PCI-E slots. There it still currently resides sitting quietly all day until I return from work in the evening to perhaps do a little web design or listen to the 70 odd gigs of music I have stashed away. A simple task you might think, but not for MSI, it justs freezes when you least expect it.No amount of BIOS updates or re-configuring of internal cabling will remedy this, instability is an added feature of MSI boards. The best part is, it only crashes during normal windows usage, not hardcore gaming – bizarre….It’s in all honesty the first board I’m thinking of ditching with another and just plain rubbish.</p>

<div class="author_meta">02 Feb 2006</div>
<p>I’ve just been informed that my paper for <a href="http://pdcc.ntu.edu.sg/ccgrid2006/" title="CCGRID06">CCGRID06 </a>has been accepted, which I’m very pleased about. It’s my first paper acceptance in my 14 months of being based as a PhD at Cardiff University so really its about time I got some ideas out in the open to people. It’s also based in Singapore, and I’ve never left Europe – yeah it’s two days, but I’m chuffed nonetheless.</p>

<p>The ironic thing is I was a bit annoyed last year at the fact <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/ccgrid2005/" title="CCGRID05">CCGRID05 </a>was in Cardiff. I suppose its better this way round.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/02/01/cutting-edge">Cutting Edge</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">01 Feb 2006</div>
<p>My day was brightened lots yesterday when my my PhD supervisor informed me he had a blog on the subject of grid computing. It was intended for members of our research group to contribute to and discuss things. The most amusing part was, being cutting edge and all, you’d expect it to be a bustling hive of activity. What I actually found was a <a href="http://gridder.blogspot.com/">site</a> with <strong>two posts</strong> covering the last 2 years. Yup, that’ll about do it.</p>
