        I&#8217;ve not spoken in a long time on here and it seems I&#8217;m getting harassed into doing so, so I thought I&#8217;d air some stuff.
It&#8217;s the New Year! Woohoo! Christmas brought with it all the usual stuff, like parents moaning about computers and arguing about nothing. This year I only crept back for a very short time in which to see family and catch up. It seems like Yeovil is less and less like my home now, with friends moving away and all.

        I cleaned out one of the boxes of papers kicking around my room the other evening. In it, I found an old lunch pass from school (featuring a photo sporting a lovely little version of me) and lots of old encouragement sheets we used to pass around our youth group to gets lots of positive comments on ourselves. Most of these are at least 5 years old and some stretch back to 10.

        On Thursday morning, Maggie, our eldest labrador at home was taken to the vet to be put down. She&#8217;d been poorly for sometime and had become unable to walk, for any reason whatsoever. Maggie was a member of our family for the past 13 years, so it&#8217;s understandably a bit of a loss to us all. It&#8217;s strange to think back to when we first got her, making apologies to numerous teachers for the state the new books I&#8217;d been given had gotten into so quickly.

        I spent the weekend back at home in recognition of my parents 30th wedding anniversary. It&#8217;s quite bizarre looking through their wedding photos (I&#8217;d never seen them before) and picking out all my relatives in mini form. Said previous ladyfriend decided she&#8217;d brave the border as well to make those &#8220;all important&#8221; first introductions. She might of thought better of it if she knew parentals were going to bring their saturday night party back to ours and keep everyone awake until the early hours.

        I think I&#8217;m a little less than perceptive of situations in which I&#8217;m involved. Recently, I&#8217;ve been clued in to a number of things which makes me think I&#8217;ve been carrying freeriding on this life while I could of been part of something so much more interesting. This isn&#8217;t a direct attack on anyone but myself, so don&#8217;t anyone take it to heart. I think this is best shown through the forming of a type of relationship I&#8217;ve been starved of for the best part of my life, one with my lovely new girlfriend.

        Some of the thoughts in this post over at Barbara&#8217;s really hit home with me today. I don&#8217;t often take time to reflect on pointers like these but the majority of them are ringing alarm bells about some aspect of my life at the moment.

        From a sample upon the dischandler (DJ Moneyshot):
&#8220;No one wants to be a failure, no one wants a life constantly filled with worry, fear and frustration. Therefore you must remember to reap that which you sow. If you sow negative thoughts, your life will be filled with negative things. If you sow positive thoughts, your life will be cheerful, successful and positive.&#8221;
Not so sure how this pads out in real life&#8230;

        So, I&#8217;ve had not a lot of response to my situation with ebuyer of late, but this recent email I recieved from them sent me over the edge &#8211; I&#8217;d sent them 7 emails and phoned 2 times with a 40 min wait prior to recieving this.

        I went round to Living Stones last night for a bit of a lads night with Jon, Dan, Rob and Joe for music and watching Batman Begins. I took a number of Cd&#8217;s for Dan and I to listen to, which basically reflected the &#8220;base&#8221; around which the majority of all my other music stems from. It&#8217;s quite odd trying to verbalise how a particular song makes you feel, why you feel uplifted by it, how it captures a particular moment in time, thought, etc etc.
