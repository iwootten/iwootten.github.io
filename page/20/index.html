<p>So, I’ve had not a lot of response to my situation with ebuyer of late, but this recent email I recieved from them sent me over the edge – I’d sent them 7 emails and phoned 2 times with a 40 min wait prior to recieving this.<br />
———————————————————————————————————-<br />

<p>Dear Sir / Madam,</p>

<p>Thank you for informing us of your missing item. When we are believed to have short shipped an<br />
item, we carry out a series of checks to make sure that the item has not been dispatched.</p>

<p>Our first check is to recreate the order in our warehouse, and match that weight against the weight<br />
of your order when it was shipped. We have carried out this check, and the<br />
weights show we have shipped the item. This means we have to further investigate the missing item, by<br />
checking the parcel with Citylink, our couriers, and possibly reporting to the relevant<br />
authorities should something seem suspect.</p>

<p>We have performed these checks and believe goods to have shipped on this occasion. However, if an<br />
incorect item/s have been delivered, please advise as this will account for the weight check and we<br />
can investigate further.</p>

<p>Thank you for your patience and co-operation in this matter.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Ebuyer Customer Support</p>

<p>———————————————————————————————————-</p>

<p>In response to your email of 03/11/05:</p>

<p>Dear ebuyer,</p>

<p>I’d be interested to know why exactly you think I’d make a complaint that an item had not been delivered if it had? I have been a loyal customer of ebuyers since 2002 – making over £3200 worth of purchases over that time! – all of which further adds to the horrendous way in which you are treating me, I am extremely annoyed.</p>

<p>I’d also add that this method of checking weight descrepencies between items is horrendously flawed in this matter – you believe you can account for the difference of a weight of a unboxed oem cd and leaflet, by recreating it in the warehouse?! The weight of these items is comparable to the air-packing which you ship with every order, ie nothing!</p>

<p>If you’d fully read my enotes you would see that I’ve told you the item has not been shipped, in every note I left, there we no boxes opened or damaged, so looking into your delivery companies actions seems rather pointless – I’ve had to purchase this elsewhere due to the decided lack of response on ebuyers part, incurring further cost to myself. In the course of a month, you have spent your time not listening to me, lying to me upon the phone, giving me information which I already know and have informed you of.</p>

<p>Suffice to say I shall not be purchasing from you in the future and by the looks of things may have to employ the services of a solicitor in order to retrieve my money anyway.</p>

<p>This situation is ridiculous – I expect a full refund immediately, I was initially told this matter would be resolved in a day, and your continued lack of action is deplorable.</p>

<p>Mr I.M.Wootten</p>

<p>——————————————————————————————————-<br />
Dear Mr Wootten,</p>

<p>The email which has been sent to you so we can gain further information to assist us with our enquiries. The weights of the parcels are showing as that the item has shipped. Can you please advise if you received an incorrect item or was any of the packaging damaged on arrival.</p>

<p>Kind Regards<br />
Sarah<br />
Ebuyer Customer Support Team</p>

<p>———————————————————————————————————-<br />
I think the content of every enote I have ever written, along with the last I’ve just written covers this as well as the title of this post. The item is “Missing”. I had no extra items delivered, no boxes opened or damaged, I had the DVDRW Drive, Thermal Grease, Nero Express CD OEM in one package and the Logitech Keyboard bundle in another in the last consignment delivery.</p>

<p>———————————————————————————————————<br />
Dear Mr Wootten,</p>

<p>Your card has now been refunded. The funds will be in your account in the next 3-4 working days.</p>

<p>Kind Regards<br />
Sarah<br />
Ebuyer Customer Support Team</p>

<div class="author_meta">30 Oct 2005</div>
<p>I went round to Living Stones last night for a bit of a lads night with Jon, Dan, Rob and Joe for music and watching Batman Begins. I took a number of Cd’s for Dan and I to listen to, which basically reflected the “base” around which the majority of all my other music stems from. It’s quite odd trying to verbalise how a particular song makes you feel, why you feel uplifted by it, how it captures a particular moment in time, thought, etc etc. It’s more odd because I don’t tend to talk about my music tastes much and coming to terms with what mainstream music means to me is surreal.</p>

<p>“It’s not who we are, but what we do that defines us…”</p>

<div class="author_meta">24 Oct 2005</div>
<p>I’ve been attending a fair few ‘live’ gigs recently as oppose to the frequenting of clubs in Cardiff. The first was the fantastic <a href="http://www.royksopp.com/">Röyksopp</a>, whom I was dubious to see alone, but glad I did. Quite frankly they were as great live as I could possibly hope for and the addition of the huge inflatable tape and scrolling info about each song added to the experience.</p>

<p>More recently, I got to see <a href="http://www.bowlingforsoup.com">“Bowling for Soup”</a> at union on Friday, which allowed me to experience the ‘delights’ of teen punk as well as some awful “post-punk laptop (c)rap” from <a href="http://www.mclars.com">Mc Lars</a> who seemed confused as to where exactly Cardiff featured in the UK. When <a href="http://www.americanhi-fi.com/">American Hi-Fi</a> landed as support, the kiddies got a tad excited and decided to vent their frustrations of the last week before half-term by forming a number of mosh pits and jumping into one another. Not fully understanding this myself, we backed off to safer havens and observed further stupidity from there.</p>

<p>Saturday was a return to old pastures for me, providing a warm-up for <a href="http://www.todah.co.uk/2005/">Todah</a>, who are as great live as their website suggests. The venue (the old apostolic church in swansea), was highly unique allowing me to play in the most random room ever as the youth were crammed in like sardines. It was great fun, reminding me of the older youth events we used to hold in Yeovil prior to the move into the new building. It was also awesome to get paid to perform and enjoy worship. I decided to give Heledd a buzz whilst I was there (possibly a little belated I realise) and we ended up going for a fab Indian with the band after, with much laughter involved. Unfortunately it seems some CV’ers might have inferred a little too much from the outing, (big stick, wrong end), but to be fair it’s nice to know that people pay enough of an interest in my life to be bothered by that.</p>

<p>I found a wicked animation by Maria Claudia Cortes describing what personalities a bunch of colours are often attributed with. I reckon I’m a mixture of red and blue, my wardrobe reflects this as well. <a href="http://www.mariaclaudiacortes.com/">What colour are you?</a></p>

<p>Whats the most annoying thing ebuyer could leave out of my order for my building a new PC? That’s it – the OS, so I can build my lovely little machine, but not actually use the thing until they get their act together. Nice one guys, you <a href="http://www.ebuyersucks.com">suck ass</a>.</p>

<p>I’ve always bought lots of music. Those of you who’ve had the privilege of viewing my collection will have seen it spans all manner of media, Tape, CD, MD, Vinyl. I’ve recently been doing a lot of random browsing on ebay for CD’s that have previously escaped me and possibly buying a few other items from the same seller to save on postage. My biggest one though has to be my most recent, 12 albums from the same seller. It’s allowed me to reminice the awesome Orb, along with Orbital, Goldie and earlier William Orbit albums whilst exploring a bunch of cheesy trance as well. All for the bargain price of £17! – a sum which I may have paid for a single album in the past. My how times change…</p>

<p>My latest favourite ol’ electronica hit as a result is “Orb – Little Fluffy Clouds”.</p>

<div class="author_meta">26 Sep 2005</div>
<p>I’m feeling rather fragile at the moment, which is really annoying because the majority of the time I’m the picture of health. It started yesterday, but I thought I’d got over it only for headaches and tummy aches to return by the evening. Unfortunately, it meant I wasn’t best of hosts to Hannah who stayed over on Sunday because of a stereophonics gig she was going to. I had to fix her up with Jon to go with as her mate decided to back out on her pretty late. Hannah got a few odd looks at the prospect of her taking her inflatable guitar though.. </p>

<p>Todays been enrolment, which is just a pain as well due to central being at talybont and departmental being down in Queens. I think I must have been quite out of it as I just randomly decided to queue with people in trevithick, until realising that actually my enrolment was in a completely different building and had been every year I’d been there.</p>

<p>Theres noticeably more students around here and less parking spaces. So much so as some old welsh coot decided to give me verbal for no apparent reason outside my house. I won’t describe in detail what happened but suffice to say he was obviously mad. Anyways, I guess there’ll be more of that in the pipeline over the coming year…</p>

<p>I was contemplating all the stuff I generally tend to blog about. Most of the time, something rather huge has to happen for me in my week to be bothered to blog about it and then a large majority of that goes unnoticed by you, my readers (both of you), due to concerns about upsetting people, getting upset by people or not reflecting myself in the best of light. Other stuff, I just don’t think is interesting at all, but I’ve been told that while I think it mundane, it proves amusing to others. This perhaps gives a few insights as to why my blogging doesn’t occur as often as those who feel it neccessary to pour out their innermost thoughts every day, or maybe I don’t have enough of them to warrant talking about…</p>

<p>That last post aside heres a mildly amusing anecdote that happened to me whilst in B&#038;Q a couple of weeks ago featuring a sweet old welsh lady.</p>

<p>Old Lady (Looking at lampshades): “Is that the ACTUAL price of these!?”<br />
Me (Bewildered, wondering past end of aisle): “Well, yeah, it says so on the label”<br />
Old Lady: “£11.99! I saw ‘em for £1 on Newport Road!”<br />
Me (Still bewildered, now in aisle): “Oh. Right. Ok…”<br />
Old Lady: “I’m gonna have to go all the way back down there now..”<br />
Me: “Hmmm…”<br />
Old Lady: “Are you sure these are the only ones you’ve got?!”<br />
Me (Clued in now): “Er, yeah, I don’t actually work here.”<br />
Old Lady: “Oh I’m sorry love (now embarrased to look me in the eye, me backing away), its because you’ve got a black shirt on.”</p>

<p>Well, wearing “a black shirt” is certainly the least amount of requirements I’ve had for any job. It might have been hilarious to just continue the appalling customer service and hand in one of (my co-)workers names as my own when she asked for it…</p>

<p>Some of you may have noticed that I’ve moved. Whats that? You didn’t? Oh well, cheers then, how much of a friend are you? I never read your blog either. For those who didn’t – take a look in the address bar, I’m now at <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk" title="This page">www.ianwootten.co.uk</a> (Highly original I know!).</p>

<p>This week I have been mostly stressing about work, sitting at home alone, watching repeats, finding interesting links through the wonder of <a href="http://del.icio.us" title="Social Bookmarks">del.icio.us</a> and making my mark on other peoples property (an all too common occurence, apologies 48 Mackie Pl).</p>
