        Hello. Today marked the second day in the workshop I’m attending and the presentation of some of my own work and thoughts. I’ve also experienced some very useful thoughts of not only my work, but my PhD as a whole. Today is a good day for that.
Yesterday evening we attended an italian restaurant as part of the evening meals for the conference, which featured such a ridulous amount of food it was stupid.

        So today marked the checking in and out of hotels to move down the road in preparation for my workshop I’m attending while I’m here. Here’s some views of my hotel room looking out onto Sears, complete with the only person whom is here with me. I have to head out now, for the conference dinner etc. I shall be sure to post later.

        Today, after yesterdays success, and it being fairly sunny, I decided to try and find Sears Tower (The USA’s tallest building) and come home fresh in the knowledge I had ascended it. People were all trying to put me off going as the views from Sears weren’t as good as those from the Hancock observatory, which sits on the Magnificent Mile and gives nice views of the shore of Lake Michigan.

        I have an uncanny habit of organising travel on unique dates. Last year my journey to Edinburgh for a conference was held up because it was the day before the G8 summit, when Viv and I went to Dublin, I completely forgot about the fact St Patricks day would fall around that time. My journey to Chicago it would seem is not to be blessed without this feature either. I’ll let you in on what happened in a sec.

        So I’ve arrived safe and sound in Chicago! I’m quite glad about that as it means I’m not dead, murdered or anything like that from what came from my whole journey…
I didn’t realise how much of a strain etc travelling could be, mainly because I’ve never come this far before (actually, I’ve never been outside of Europe). I had to set off at around 8.00am from home, catching a train to get to Gatwick for 11.

        Its been a long time without me saying anything much, but lots and lots going on. The first event to note was that I had my car attempted to be broken into over here in Roath, I suppose that eventually that this was bound to happen being in a city centre and all I guess until now I’ve been lucky. They tried to get in through the passenger side door, bending it out and giving up after not getting in.

        I’m always coming up with concepts for websites, but I thought this one was worth blogging about. Basically, my idea is that you give yourself a budget of say 99p on ebay and see what kind of profit you can get from that by selling it again….on ebay… and so on until you flop and lose all your profit, or give up and bag the benefits of being able to spell and take photographs.

        A few weeks ago, I noticed that worpdress.com, org and net weren’t registered, despite their similarity to the excellent blogging tool wordpress’s domain. I thought it was too good an opportunity to be missed, and registered the lot of them.After a couple of posts on the wordpress forums, and the realisation that there was no way in hell I’d ever have the time to put anything there, I decided to donate them to Matt Mullenweg, so at least they were redirecting the one or two people who might hit them to the correct wordpress site.

        I’ve recently, through many searches to do with AJAX, Web 2.0 and the like been perusing digg.com, that fairly new web site for geeks.Basically, it’s a social booking marking site where users “digg” those sites which they find interesting, as more users digg the same pages, they get promoted up through to the main page, or higher up through the rankings within particular categories. Its a really interesting concept, quite similar to del.
