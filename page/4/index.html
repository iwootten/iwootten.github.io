        I&#8217;ve long made use of the default theme on WordPress, which I&#8217;ve always felt wasn&#8217;t entirely &#8220;me&#8221;. The theme now live is one I&#8217;ve been tinkering with for a while now based on the lovely preview design used in the prose.io document editing tool for github. I really like the focus on simplicity and think it suits me well.
I&#8217;ve added some different styling for the navigation elements, given they didn&#8217;t already exist on prose.

        I feel compelled to write this post so late in the day after clocking Tyler Renelle&#8217;s rant on github about his problems with the popularity of certain JS frameworks (in the main Backbone.js). After having written apps in a variety of JS frameworks (Backbone, Spine and Meteor), I&#8217;ve learned that the feature set of a framework is not the only thing I hold dear when making a choice between them.

        So here we are in a brand new year. 2012 came and went without even the slightest apocalypse. Reflecting on what has been achieved this past year has found favour with others in the web profession so I thought I might try it. More importantly to me, it also seems like a good way to perhaps spur me on to achieve some firm targets this year.
My circumstances have dramatically changed since January last year.

        When I was first tiptoeing in the waters of web development (early 2000&#8242;s), getting a grips on job descriptions was simple. There were 2 types of people in our industry: designers or developers. You either drew websites, or you built websites &#8211; that was it.
As time went on people seemed to invent new titles: &#8220;UX Designers&#8221; were the first to appear on the scene to me, and we&#8217;re still to this day figuring out what this role really entails.

        Given there&#8217;s a bit of lovefilm bashing going on in Wales at the moment, I thought I&#8217;d chime in with the most frustrating thing I found with communications from lovefilm.
Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I&#8217;ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.

I really couldn&#8217;t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema&#8217;s to perform reviews and certainly don&#8217;t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image.

        I had the horrible situation last Sunday following removing a number of pictures using an SD reader from my SD card that when I inserted it in my camera, it registered nothing upon it. My heart sunk, because this card is stuffed full of images of me and my family (along with my 1 year old son growing up) and I was unsure of which ones I&#8217;d actually backed up.

        This is a talk I did back in May at unifieddiff about my time working as a web developer at Aardman Features. I talk quite a bit about the production process and what we take from staff in order to help them do their jobs properly. I quite enjoyed giving this talk &#8211; more so than those I&#8217;ve given in an academic capacity in the past.

        What are you doing? Why would you go down that road? Shouldn’t you be building something else? How long have you been doing this?
Sure you can fool your clients into thinking you’re adding value to their product. I know the truth. But how did you &#8211; with all your expertise get to the point in thinking that’s what you’re really doing?
This is your first project? Shouldn’t you be focusing on your clients problems?

        If my years in academia have taught me anything, it&#8217;s that insight obvious to you isn&#8217;t often obvious to others.
As a result, I&#8217;ve pretty much adopted a gung-ho hacker attitude towards getting my own ideas built whereby I&#8217;ll just often work to get an iteration of an site out as fast as possible. The only factor here is my own time and I&#8217;m in the fortunate position to have some of that available now and again.
