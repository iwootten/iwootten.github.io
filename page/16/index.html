        A couple of weeks back I discovered a slug in cash converters. Well, a usb2 external disk to nas drive converter affectionately known as the slug. Seeing as how I&#8217;ve been considering purchasing one, I figured shelling out the £25 was worth it for an experiment with installing linux on it for a bit. The D-Link nslu2 features two usb2 connection points for hooking up usb2 drives, but I didn&#8217;t really feel like sacrificing my university external box as this usually comes in quite useful.

        Another post about ubuntu? Where will it end?I was fairly excited from thursday evenings antics of getting things working on my machine at home, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try with my dev machine at uni. My graphics card, a 9600 (yes ATI, I know!) had been screwed since the day I&#8217;d put on Dapper, and to be honest, as I&#8217;m not using it that much for GL stuff, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered about it.

        It seems I may have spoken too soon about my linux joys with ubuntu. After performing a dist-upgrade on my previous beta version of Dapper, I discovered I&#8217;d have to go through the same problems of downloading kernel source and linux header packages for my new kernel version.I also discovered after doing this that actually there were further problems on booting Dapper straight up. Apparently the pointers to drives get screwed up somewhere in the process.

        You&#8217;d think that thieves would be content who&#8217;d bent my door back along to try and nick my car, realising actually I have nothing of value. Or that by monitoring my movements over a period of time, the opportune time to get into it would be when I went away to Dublin, Chicago or Singapore for weeks on end. Apparently not, in fact, they think its such a prime example of Vauxhalls lack of security that they would in fact like to come back and try to nick it by bending out the other door right when I&#8217;m here.

        FInally, after a grand total of 10 months, I have a 64bit version of Ubuntu Linux working upon my home machine.This is great news, not only does it mean that I have a wonderful OS to try out for size, but that I can easily convert my subversion server code and latex source to my machine.As I&#8217;ve never mentioned it before, I&#8217;ll detail what the problem was here. First up, the graphics card didn&#8217;t have drivers which were working which meant that my X800 was pretty pathetic to be quite honest with you.

        Yesterday I got a little annoyed about the fact that it seemed as if play had forgotten all details of my existence and telling me my email address was wrong. After sending a little letter off to them complaining yesterday evening, I realised after their response that actually I&#8217;d altered my saved email a little while before. I went ahead and placed my order of Sideways this morning which I&#8217;d expected to be fairly good due to the rave reviews I&#8217;d heard of it.

        From &#8220;How To Succeed With Women Without Really Trying&#8221; c1957
&#8220;The first wife, as opposed to the fiancee, must be practicable and serviceable. She is neither a toy, an ornament, nor a playmate. She will be your wife during the early, hard years before you can afford a staff of servants. She will serve as mother, cook, housemaid, chauffeur, nurse, and charwoman. This will allow her, if she is nimble, six or seven hours of sleep a night, ample for a sturdy girl.

        So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).

        Woohoo, rock on &#8211; its almost holiday season for me. Next week I&#8217;ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh&#8230;Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I&#8217;ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who&#8217;ll be there with me &#8211; you best make it a good&#8217;n.

        Currently, I&#8217;ve been spending many an hour pondering domain name choices for a fair trade t-shirt site I&#8217;d like to set-up, but never actually committing to one, due to the rather lacklustre responses of others on hearing my suggestions, or not finding anything suitable which conveys what I am trying to get across (a hip, trendy t-shirt place, ala threadless.com).If anyone can think of anything clever &#8211; let me know.
