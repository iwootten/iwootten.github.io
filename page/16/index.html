          <p>Last night I attended the FOWA Roadtrip in Cardiff, which was great. Unfortunately my &#8220;business&#8221; cards were a little lacking, due to me making a rather late order from moo and having to put something together by hand for the interim. They instead arrived today, about 14 hours too late. I felt like writing &#8220;beta&#8221; on hand hand-made ones or something&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">08 Sep 2007</div>

          <p>Since moving to Taffs Well, just outside of Cardiff, Viv and I have enjoyed fantastic views of the Garth. This mountain is the centre for the original true story of &#8220;The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down A Mountain&#8221;, a book/film which I managed to catch on TV this week. Basically, it goes like this, the villagers of Taffs Well work together to try to prevent an English cartographer from leaving the village and classifying the Garth as a hill. They gradually take soil to the top of the (then) hill and eventually get it classed as a mountain by the cartographer. Carrying all that soil is no easy feat &#8211; it does require roping in all the villagers into getting it up the hill. It was quite amusing to be sitting in our living room watching a film about the mountain which could be seen through the window right next to our television. Anyway I&#8217;m really enjoying it out here &#8211; its such a sight to wake up every morning and see the Garth covered in cloud at its peak. I hope Viv and I get the chance and enough enthusiasm to walk it together soon. <a href="http://blog.stuartherbert.com/">Stuart Herbert</a> has some <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stuartherbert/tags/thegarth/">great pics of the Garth on flickr</a>.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve long wondered why there doesn&#8217;t seem to be much happening in terms of community of the web professionals in wales. There is a vibrant collection of people sporting different skill sets in the area, yet as I can see not a lot of chat amongst everyone in between different groups. On a whim, I decided to create a facebook group &#8220;<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=5399328503">Cardiff Web Geeks</a>&#8221; to try and get people to come out of their shells and actually participate in a bit of discussion about tech topics in wales. I&#8217;ve invited a bunch of people who might be interested and hopefully we&#8217;ll be able to organise some sort of chats and discussions at meetups, rather than having to cross the border back to England and sponge from our friends over there. (Each one of those return trips costs&#8230;) If you are interested in what&#8217;s going on with people and the web in Wales, I&#8217;d invite you to sign up and participate in what hopefully could be built into a nice valuable community in our local area. </p>
<p>[Update - We now have our own <a href="http://cardiffgeeks.net">website</a>! Rock on!]</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 Sep 2007</div>

          <p>Wow, Apple have released a new touch version of the iPod (think the iPhone with no phone) as well as updating the classic iPod (160Gb!) and new nano versions. This actually means I&#8217;d be able to have an iPod which fits my entire music collection upon it with room to spare. I&#8217;ve waited a long time for that. The iPod touch also allows wireless browsing and download of new music via iTunes. Nano versions now rock up in both 4Gb standard and 8Gb models. I&#8217;m sure someone in our department will have one before long&#8230;.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">31 Aug 2007</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve heard a <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/would_you_share_your_search_history.php">couple</a> of <a href="http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/08/google-facebook-app.html">rumours</a> this evening that google may be launching a facebook app that allows your friends to see your search trends over time via your facebook mini feed. There&#8217;s some discussion over on <a href="http://facereviews.com/2007/08/28/google-facebook-application-a-hoax/">facereviews.com</a> that anything like this exists, but for me it raises an interesting question about how much information people are willing to share within their own &#8220;social networks&#8221;. Would I be comfortable with everyone knowing what I was searching for? Probably not at all &#8211; I don&#8217;t want everyone to be clued in to all those random tee sites I&#8217;m able to find. Probably nobody would really be interested, so whats the point anyway?</p>

<p>It also brings to mind an idea that I&#8217;ve been toying with for sharing how links between pages are made, where details of hyperlink clicks are captured to some repository somewhere. This would make it it possible for users to have a series of heatmaps upon any page to display details of common links that other users choose to follow from one page to another, and common routes accross the net to particular pages. Similar issues for whether or not takeup would occur, or the information is indeed useful to everyone exist also.</p>
