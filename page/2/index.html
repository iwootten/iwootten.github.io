        Laws on when to apply VAT have always been a complex beast - in 2015 the EU made changes that meant that VAT was to be calculated based on a customer location, introducing a VATMOSS system for its collection. Since leaving the EU things have become even more complicated if you happen to be based in the UK. You now are no longer able to make use of the VATMOSS system, meaning you potentially need to register for VAT in every EU country you sell products to (!

        In this post I&rsquo;m going to show how to generate images for sharing content on social networks like twitter and facebook using Puppeteer. This could be for any content - a post on our blog or something more complex like a dynamic storefront. So long as we correctly include open graph meta tags within the markup appropriate for the sites in question, our nicely designed image will be included as part of the apps feeds, rather than a blank preview.

        In my 18 years online, I&rsquo;ve spent large chunks of time exploring ideas that never came into fruition. I&rsquo;ve gone years building out software I&rsquo;ve never made into saleable products for a multitude of reasons. The standard indie hacker journey would have you believe that this is time wasted, pointless where iterating quickly and shipping products that sell would get you to that magic monthly recurring revenue you so desperately desire.

        In my previous post, I described how you can use Python and Makefiles to quickly get new projects started. In this post I explore how you can use cookiecutters more advanced Jinja templating techniques to make a cookiecutter that can be used for multiple package managers. Specifically, we&rsquo;ll be extending the existing template to build another that can be used with either Poetry or Pipenv.
Our New Cookiecutter Template As a reminder, Cookiecutter allows us to template project and directory content and structure using Jinja2 logic.

        When starting a new project, it’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of starting the shiny new thing and forget about some basics. What starts out as a script slowly evolves into an application and before long you’ll find yourself repeating common steps for every project to get it to match personal preferences. If you happen to be working within on a team, you may have many repositories that should have the same setup and inconsistencies between them can quickly lead to large amounts of lost time to get them aligned.

        No doubt if you&rsquo;ve been developing in Python for any length of time, you will have heard the acronym &ldquo;PEP&rdquo; mentioned quite frequently. More often than not you hear it when talking about Python code style, usually followed by the number &ldquo;8&rdquo;. So what is a PEP and why should you care?
What is a PEP? PEP stands for &ldquo;Python Enhancement Proposal&rdquo;. They are used to describe and summarise the technical design and reasons for enhancements to Python and surrounding processes.

        When I first started working in software development teams, I can remember heated discussions on pull requests on a few occasions. Typically these were when I or other developers reviewed code that didn&rsquo;t meet formatting rules that were felt best for that piece of work. It didn&rsquo;t matter whether the rules in question were in code, documented in a README or just held in a developers head, the simple fact that something was wrong on the project meant the author needed to make changes, be severely reprimanded and never make the mistake again.

        Digitalocean recently launched their App platform, a platform as a service (PaaS) which can be seen as a competitor to the likes of Heroku. As a Python developer, I wanted to see how easy it was to deploy a django app to App platform. It took me a little while to configure everything correctly so I thought I&rsquo;d go through some of the points that tripped me up here.
I&rsquo;ve been looking for some time for a relatively simple method for deploying my projects, but I also want to use a pattern where my repo is the primary source of truth for my app.

        In creating my first package on PyPI, I realised that many of the tasks I&rsquo;d want to do on a subsequent publish would be repetitive. If I wanted to push out a simple fix, I wanted to automate away those tasks so I could focus on my code rather than a sequence of repetitive steps.
Github actions is a simple way to do this and has given me the ability to quickly push out changes without lots of manual work.
