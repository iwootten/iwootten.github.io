First up, the graphics card didn’t have drivers which were working which meant that my X800 was pretty pathetic to be quite honest with you. There was a fairly simple solution through apt, which would have been nice if………………the network card on my A8N-VM CSM was working properly, which it wasn’t, due to use of an NFORCE chipset. A build of some drivers were neccessary, which required adding a load of packages (simple if apt were working!).Anyway, several days of man hours later, and this ubuntu thing works wonderfully. If you’re having similar troubles with this board, its probably best to use <a href=https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvNetInstallation title="Ubuntu NVNet installation">this page</a> for guidance.</p></div><div class="navigation navigation-single"><a href=https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/07/27/the-bitter-irony/ class=navigation-prev><i aria-hidden=true class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i>
