    <p>You&#8217;d think that thieves would be content who&#8217;d bent my door back along to try and nick my car, realising actually I have nothing of value. Or that by monitoring my movements over a period of time, the opportune time to get into it would be when I went away to Dublin, Chicago or Singapore for weeks on end. Apparently not, in fact, they think its such a prime example of Vauxhalls lack of security that they would in fact like to come back and try to nick it by bending out the other door right when I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m half tempted to leave a note saying &#8220;theres nothing of value in here, honest&#8221; but I fear it would make it all the more amusing to the little wotsits.</p>

<p>Nothing taken except my self esteem from the last week unfortunately. That and the badge of a &pound;60k Merc near the rec.</p>
