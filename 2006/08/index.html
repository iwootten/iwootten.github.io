          <p>I&#8217;ve been experimenting with <a href="http://www.codeigniter.com">code igniter</a> tonight, a php mvc framework. I discovered it yesterday, not realising that such things were available for php. As its extremely lightweight and seems to speeding up things no-end already, I reckon I&#8217;ll probably be using it on some of my new <a href="http://www.slimshot.org">slimshot</a> projects I&#8217;m planning on working on soon. I just need to get another life somewhere so I can actually go about implementing all this stuff.</p>

          <p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to create a site which attracts lot of attention for ages. Not to create some profit-making venture, just to know that my voice was being listened too elsewhere and hopefully appreciated. I suppose that goes for my PhD too. It&#8217;s kind of depressing however that almost everything ever has been done, and every avenue seems blocked in both respects. How do you contribute to a world that is uninsterested in what you have to say? Being a man of high moral standards (!) I don&#8217;t ditch them and say what I think people want to hear, I suffer at their hands silently instead.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">13 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>A couple of weeks back I discovered a slug in cash converters. Well, a usb2 external disk to nas drive converter affectionately known as the slug. Seeing as how I&#8217;ve been considering purchasing one, I figured shelling out the £25 was worth it for an experiment with <a href="http://www.nslu2-linux.org">installing linux</a> on it for a bit. The D-Link nslu2 features two usb2 connection points for hooking up usb2 drives, but I didn&#8217;t really feel like sacrificing my university external box as this usually comes in quite useful.Enter an icy box, one of the new sata ones, to encompass a normal hard drive &#8211; which fitted in quite well with the sata drive I purchased for my machine at uni, but never actually ended up using. In total i spent about £90 on the lot I think.I decided to get on with moving everything onto it yesterday, and first off was the 75Gb mp3 collection &#8211; taking a total of about 4 hours&#8230;. Next&#8217;ll be the 10Gb downloads directory (which I could probably do with emptying really).If I ever get round to installing linux (as it sounds a little bit of an arse) upon the slug, it could be quite sweet to set it up with <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_features.html">slim server</a> to finally have a completely silent mp3 stream in my house&#8230;..of course, this also would require investing in a <a href="http://www.slimdevices.com/pi_overview.html">squeezebox</a>, or something similar.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">12 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>Another post about ubuntu? Where will it end?I was fairly excited from thursday evenings antics of getting things working on my machine at home, I thought I&#8217;d give it a try with my dev machine at uni. My graphics card, a 9600 (yes ATI, I know!) had been screwed since the day I&#8217;d put on Dapper, and to be honest, as I&#8217;m not using it that much for GL stuff, I wasn&#8217;t really bothered about it. After installing the ATI drivers, them not working and reinstalling the fglrx xorg drivers, I managed to get it working nicely within about 30 mins. <a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Installation_Guide" title="Unofficial ATI Linux Driver Wiki">This wiki page</a> may help if you&#8217;re experiencing similar problems. In my case, my driver was loading, but I was having a problem with libdri.a menaing 3d acceleration got switched off. Anyway, glxgears is now shuvving out a good 3000+ fps so I&#8217;m happy enough with that.Aha, I thought, I&#8217;ll give the soundcard a bash &#8211; a 6 year old SBLive Platinum complete with live drive. Although this (with some tweaking in alsamixer) give outputs on the pci card, the front bay wasn&#8217;t getting any output to the headphone socket. I tried to install and compile the latest emu10k drivers from <a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/" title="Advanced Linux Sound Architecture">alsa</a>, but then everything got screwed up and no drivers were loading. I removed them and reinstalled what I had before. I carried on with my troubles, inspecting my front bay for any connection problems, notcing one fairly major one&#8230;..having the headphones in the mic input &#8211; doh! I&#8217;d do well to check the obvious things first in the future.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">10 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>It seems I may have spoken too soon about my linux joys with ubuntu. After performing a dist-upgrade on my previous beta version of Dapper, I discovered I&#8217;d have to go through the same problems of downloading kernel source and linux header packages for my new kernel version.I also discovered after doing this that actually there were further problems on booting Dapper straight up. Apparently the pointers to drives get screwed up somewhere in the process. Although I could boot into X using just the safety mode and booting from there, this wasn&#8217;t ideal and I still wanted my lovely little 64 bit install to be working nicely. I dicovered that adding the line ide=nodma to the line of the reference in grub solved the problem.So I&#8217;m in, great you might think, but oh no &#8211; lets try amarok on for size too&#8230; Amarok (A shiny linux media player I discoved) wasn&#8217;t playing any of my mp3&#8242;s at all, just whizzing through the lot of them. A short search revealed that in using the xine engine, xine needed further codecs to be installed to get sound out too. You&#8217;d think that a dependency would be put in place here to sort this out by default. One nice feature I like is the inbuilt submission to last.fm, a great idea in my book &#8211; I use it all the time.Anyway, <em>now </em>my Ubuntu is being nice. Oh no, have I just jinxed it?</p>
