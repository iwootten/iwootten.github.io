      <div class="author_meta">07 Aug 2006</div>

          <p>FInally, after a grand total of 10 months, I have a 64bit version of Ubuntu Linux working upon my home machine.This is great news, not only does it mean that I have a wonderful OS to try out for size, but that I can easily convert my subversion server code and latex source to my machine.As I&#8217;ve never mentioned it before, I&#8217;ll detail what the problem was here. First up, the graphics card didn&#8217;t have drivers which were working which meant that my X800 was pretty pathetic to be quite honest with you. There was a fairly simple solution through apt, which would have been nice if&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;the network card on my A8N-VM CSM was working properly, which it wasn&#8217;t, due to use of an NFORCE chipset. A build of some drivers were neccessary, which required adding a load of packages (simple if apt were working!).Anyway, several days of man hours later, and this ubuntu thing works wonderfully. If you&#8217;re having similar troubles with this board, its probably best to use <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NvNetInstallation" title="Ubuntu NVNet installation">this page</a> for guidance.</p>

          <p>You&#8217;d think that thieves would be content who&#8217;d bent my door back along to try and nick my car, realising actually I have nothing of value. Or that by monitoring my movements over a period of time, the opportune time to get into it would be when I went away to Dublin, Chicago or Singapore for weeks on end. Apparently not, in fact, they think its such a prime example of Vauxhalls lack of security that they would in fact like to come back and try to nick it by bending out the other door right when I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m half tempted to leave a note saying &#8220;theres nothing of value in here, honest&#8221; but I fear it would make it all the more amusing to the little wotsits.</p>
<p>Nothing taken except my self esteem from the last week unfortunately. That and the badge of a &pound;60k Merc near the rec.</p>
