    <p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to create a site which attracts lot of attention for ages. Not to create some profit-making venture, just to know that my voice was being listened too elsewhere and hopefully appreciated. I suppose that goes for my PhD too. It&#8217;s kind of depressing however that almost everything ever has been done, and every avenue seems blocked in both respects. How do you contribute to a world that is uninsterested in what you have to say? Being a man of high moral standards (!) I don&#8217;t ditch them and say what I think people want to hear, I suffer at their hands silently instead.</p>
