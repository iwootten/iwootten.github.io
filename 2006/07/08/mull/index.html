    <p>So my holiday in Mull more than surpassed the expectations I had for it. Beautiful scenery, solitude, our own private beach, lots of sheep and cows etc etc. In fact, you had to be fairly careful negotiating the roads of Mull for fear of taking out the 50 odd sheep that would block our journey to and from the house. That and the rocks (which we experienced through a blowout). We visited the smaller islands of Iona and Staffa, with both being beautiful but Staffa getting my vote (its full of puffins, rather than americans).</p>
<p>Then theres that other little thing, of my engagement to Viv, which is extremely exciting. We snuck off together to climb the hill during the afternoon and returned engaged seeing if anyone would notice the ring upon Vivs finger. Oh the children we are. She’d kind of seen it coming, but was still a little taken aback that it was happening for real I think. While I don’t know what the future holds for either of us, I do know that I want to spend it together.</p>
