    <p>So I’ve arrived safe and sound in Chicago! I’m quite glad about that as it means I’m not dead, murdered or anything like that from what came from my whole journey…</p>
<p>I didn’t realise how much of a strain etc travelling could be, mainly because I’ve never come this far before (actually, I’ve never been outside of Europe). I had to set off at around 8.00am from home, catching a train to get to Gatwick for 11.30. From there my first 8hr flight led me to Detroit setting off at 1.50pm, and then another 40min one to Chicago, followed by a train journey of about 1hr. There was a 3hr gap between those two flights too, so by the time I arrived here, I’ve been on the go for the best part of 23hrs. I also think taking the train downtown may have been a mistake, especially as I didn’t really know where the station was in relation to where I was staying. I had to take a short stroll past my residence, before realising thats where I was meant to be! I am totalled and need a good kip, I best make use of my bed as some other geezer was in it when I arrived, whom I had to shift.</p>
