      <div class="author_meta">22 May 2006</div>

          <p>So I managed to make it to the zoo yesterday, which was very exciting. More exciting though, was the night safari, where everything is minimally lit with the animals there to give a night time experience (I expect). I was a bit worried about catching buses and the like, but it was fine in the end, everything was really very well laid out, it was a doddle.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;m off to visit the somewhat artificial Sentosa island &#8211; there seems to be a bit of controversy about the fact the land is all &#8216;reclaimed&#8217;.</p>
<p>Anyway, just a short blog (I&#8217;m being timed) to let you know whats going down in Singapore.</p>
<p>Catch up with you all later,</p>
<p>Ian</p>

      <div class="author_meta">19 May 2006</div>

          <p>I’ve just returned from the conference dinner to finalise CCGRID for ’06. Tomorrow will be its last day whereupon everyone will return to their various different countries, or maybe somewhere closer for a short time on holiday. I’ve already heard of others plans to see Malaysia and Vietnam. I’ll be here until Tuesday evening to check out all that Singapore has to offer (at least I hope I will be able to).</p>
<p>Tonight’s meal was very crazy, lots of food that I wouldn’t normally eat, but I seemed to manage all 8 courses without too much trouble. Shark soup, chickens with their heads still on and lots of beer and tea were all on the menu. There was also some crazy dancing which went on between about course 6/7.</p>
<p>I’m getting a little more used to the layout of everything so far in the university, but it’s so spread out and the buildings are so similar it’s still pretty confusing. </p>
<p>I’ll get to explore the use of the MRT more than previously from tomorrow, and to explore some slightly more diverse areas I guess, with much photo taking. This includes the now infamous Orchard Road everyone has been talking about, as I have been unable to reach it previously, hopefully a few cheapo gadgets may catch my eye. I’d also like to go to the night zoo, but this is a bit awkward as it runs late at night and the last bus connection to it is fairly early in comparison in the evening. Annoying. Today is also my last day with definite internet access, so I may not post any updates until when I return afterwards. Sorry about that, especially if you’re anyone who may be even missing me.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">17 May 2006</div>

          <p>So, I have arrived safe and sound in Singapore. I got in yesterday and have been doing various CCGrid related things since. Yesterday evening, after a quick shower I headed off to find the conference venue and something to eat. Unfortunately I spent the best part of my time wondering round trying to find the venue! It was rather annoying as a large majority of pedestrian routes had been obstructed due to a huge amount of road works going on around the university premises. After asking a few people for directions I figured out where I was and have now discovered an altogether much simpler route to the university when I was able to go there in the light. The layout of the buildings is still very confusing though. I did get to see lots of Singapore at night though, so that was quite exciting and a random (what sounded Christian) rock group performing and lots of uni groups practicing playing drums and things.</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning is when my presentation is going on, so I’ve been preparing this evening for it. My hotel is nice enough, although it might have been an idea for me to have chosen somewhere slightly closer to the university, its still less than what I’d have to walk in Cardiff to uni though. I meandered over to the food court across the way from where I’m staying this evening, with I think some strange looks from the kitchen staff, though I couldn’t figure out what they were indicating. The television in the hotel is a real hotch-botch of all manner of different channels, some English, some Chinese, and the English channels are all a dire mix of old cheesy films and very bad comedy. The internet access in the hotel is also really expensive, I doubt I’ll be using it that much, so forgive me if my updates are a little less frequent than previously, I’ll have access at the conference until Friday, unless I can find somewhere else.</p>
<p>I think I’m finding this experience altogether a bit more difficult to shift to than Chicago, basically because I know I stick out a bit here and can’t speak the lingo. Hopefully things will become a bit easier soon enough.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">15 May 2006</div>

          <p>So despite having only been back in the UK for less than a week, I&#8217;m now off to Singapore, to present another paper of my work at CCGrid06. I&#8217;m slightly less nervewracked this time, but not looking forward to the ridiculous flight time (best part of 13 hours) and the time difference when I arrive (+ 7 hours). Viv tells me its a beautiful and amazingly techie place, so it sounds not at all distant from my own bedroom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and post more as and when I have interesting stuff to report!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2006</div>

          <p>So today marks the last day I&#8217;m put up in the Hard Rock, and my last full day here in the states. I awoke to a bill that had been slipped under my door to announce that I&#8217;d been charged for their &#8220;intimacy kit&#8221;, because I had moved it to have a look at it, and this constitutes a charge. I found this most amusing. I think I&#8217;ll make sure that there are no more automated charges made before I leave, seeing as how I&#8217;ve actually used nothing&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway, tonight I am hopefully off to see the mighty <a href="http://djatrak.com/">A-Trak</a> at the Empty Bottle here in Chicago. It should be fairly awesome I&#8217;ll let you know what happens later, if I can ever reach the place.</p>
