    <p>I’ve been following a number of so called “web 2.0″ companies in the uk recently via <a href="http://techcrunch.co.uk">techcrunch.co.uk</a> in order to explore what might be available to me when I need to start work this time next year. It’s quite interesting that actually, there is a number of companies cited around the Cardiff/Bristol/Bath areas that I’d never realised were in the UK.In Bath, there’s <a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a>, which also host a number of web application <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com">workshops</a> around the uk, with a <a href="http://www.dropsend.com">Drop Send</a> and <a href="http://heyamigo.net">Amigo</a>. They have a number of the speakers seminars avaliable from their website which is really cool due to <a href="http://iamcal.com">Cal Henderson</a> of <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> fame, being one of them, as well as Yahoo and Google representatives.In Cardiff there is <a href="http://www.subhub.com">Subhub</a> though I am unsure on any projects which they have been working on which I actually like the look of, but generally geared toward subscription websites, rather than building web applications.From the back of this, I’ve also been attempting work on <a href="http://mixbooth.com">mixbooth</a> during the evenings, but its extremely difficult to contain it just within there. If anyone knows of any other uk startups that are in this general vicinity, please let me know, I’d be very interested. I’m eager to get my thesis written and get into the workplace, but I have a year to go. Wish me luck……</p>
