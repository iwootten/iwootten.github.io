<p>So today marked the checking in and out of hotels to move down the road in preparation for my workshop I’m attending while I’m here. Here’s some views of my hotel room looking out onto Sears, complete with the only person whom is here with me. I have to head out now, for the conference dinner etc. I shall be sure to post later.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/05/03/chicago-day-two-sears-tower-hancock-observatory">Chicago Day Two &#8211; Sears Tower, Hancock Observatory</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">03 May 2006</div>
<p>Today, after yesterdays success, and it being fairly sunny, I decided to try and find Sears Tower (The USA’s tallest building) and come home fresh in the knowledge I had ascended it. People were all trying to put me off going as the views from Sears weren’t as good as those from the Hancock observatory, which sits on the Magnificent Mile and gives nice views of the shore of Lake Michigan. I decided, seeing as how it was only $18 total to vist the two, I might as well do that….</p>

<p>Anyway, as I had already been along Michigan Avenue I decided to cut through the various roads cutting across one another to see where I could get to. I stumbled across Chicago’s Board Of Trade, which has been recommended as a place to visit prior to leaving and numberous other fancy pants buildings, malls and T.J.Maxx (don’t know why there’s a difference between J and K from US and UK). When I got to Sears Tower, as I’d bought tickets prior, I was able to skip queues and head right to the front. After enduring as history lesson and a stupid video in the elevator, ear popping and stupid kids screaming, I was at the top of Sears. The sights were all pretty amazing as I bet you can imagine – you can have a look at the photo for an idea.</p>

<p>Once I’d done Sears, I headed off to Hancock, but decided to visit several shops and malls on the way. I had the experience of entering an Apple store which was pretty cool. You can just wonder in and use the internet, listen to music etc etc. Anyway, I carried on. Hancocks intro was a little less well done than Sears, no video, not a lot of staff. Actually security wasn’t as tight either. *Pause* – several Fire Engines just have run down the street. The thing I suddenly realised is that the photos they take at the start aren’t for security, but rather to project the image of at the top of the building (both Sears and Hancock) for purchasing when you come back down. How daft is that? </p>

<p>Views were a little less exciting this time (possibly because I’d already seen something pretty similar!) but they have the added bonus of a skywalk – which means its exposed to what you would be able to hear if there was no windows or anything. It was quite a mash of everything going on at once though. The other cool thing was being able to see the stacking of planes coming into what I guess was O Hare airport, like a tiered approach. </p>

<p>After Hancock, I sat around outside drinking a massive smoothie before going into my last mall and realising how late it was. I went past Millenium Park and took a few more photos of the “jellybean” in the sun.  </p>

<p>Now however, I am thoroughly tired and my feet kill – and I have the excitement of my workshop to look forward to tomorrow!</p>

<p>The two photo’s show the Hancock Observatory as viewed from Sears and the Sears Tower as seen from the Hancock Observatory.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/05/02/travelling-to-chicago">Travelling to Chicago</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">02 May 2006</div>
<p>So I’ve arrived safe and sound in Chicago! I’m quite glad about that as it means I’m not dead, murdered or anything like that from what came from my whole journey…</p>

<p>I didn’t realise how much of a strain etc travelling could be, mainly because I’ve never come this far before (actually, I’ve never been outside of Europe). I had to set off at around 8.00am from home, catching a train to get to Gatwick for 11.30. From there my first 8hr flight led me to Detroit setting off at 1.50pm, and then another 40min one to Chicago, followed by a train journey of about 1hr. There was a 3hr gap between those two flights too, so by the time I arrived here, I’ve been on the go for the best part of 23hrs. I also think taking the train downtown may have been a mistake, especially as I didn’t really know where the station was in relation to where I was staying. I had to take a short stroll past my residence, before realising thats where I was meant to be! I am totalled and need a good kip, I best make use of my bed as some other geezer was in it when I arrived, whom I had to shift.</p>

<p>Night night.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/05/02/chicago-day-one">Chicago Day One</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">02 May 2006</div>
<p>I have an uncanny habit of organising travel on unique dates. Last year my journey to Edinburgh for a conference was held up because it was the day before the G8 summit, when Viv and I went to Dublin, I completely forgot about the fact St Patricks day would fall around that time. My journey to Chicago it would seem is not to be blessed without this feature either. I’ll let you in on what happened in a sec.</p>

<p>I was still quite out of it when I got up, but thought I’d make the effort to adjust my body clock. I had to go and hunt for cereal, or a cafe somewhere, was given directions and went to have a look what I could find. I found some rice krispies, which did the job, and scabbed some milk someone else had left.</p>

<p>Anyone whose well up on international news might notice that there have several protests in the US by immigrants who are campaigning against a proposed immigration reform. I heard something about this on the news on the telly as I was wondering what to do with my day, but didn’t think anything much of it. How silly of me… </p>

<p>I decided, even though I was pretty darn scared that I should leave the hostel and try and do something with my day – a trundle across to the Millenium park, and a hunt for some shaving gel was on the agenda, just to see what it looked like. Before I left, I met another guy from Cardiff at the elevators, about two doors down from me. He and his mate were doing a tour across america, and this was there next port of call. I think this may have boosted my confidence to get out of the door. As I got further west, I noticed that there seemed to be rather a lot of police about (the first of whom whizzed by on a boyyed up segway!)</p>

<p>Anyway, I headed over to a fancy fountain, leaving the stack of high-rise buildings for Lake Shore Drive. More and more police (mounted on numerous methods of transport), mexicans and flags appeared. After taking a few pics of the cloudy sky, I headed over to see what the noise was about, stopping next to a news reporter tent. I got to see two news reports about the fact not a lot of people had turned out for this particular rally (did you guess yet?), just before everyone did. For a sec or two, it was a bit crazy, and I had to back out of the park bit I’d made it to. Apparently estimates put the number up to 400,000 who turned up, I spent about 2hours just watching everyone march about all the closed roads. There’s lots more on this on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4961734.stm">BBC News website</a>, its currently the top news item on the Americas site…. (and I have lots of pics too, which I’ll let people see).</p>

<p>I decided to carry on and had a look around millenium park, and the several bits of strange design it had there (Video Water Fountains and Big Reflective blobs). After that, I walked up Michigan Avenue, looking at the huge number of skyscrapers and general sights, I stopped in a couple of grocery stores and wondered over to where I will be attending my conference later in the week. It’s right next to NBC tower, so I managed to see the news being presented live inside the building, and the weather reporter (whom I’d seen earlier) presenting the weather right next to me.  </p>

</center>

<p>After that, I went back to Millennium park to sit down for a sec, and had a laugh at the various people who didn’t realise the vide walls were also fountains (they stop the water when projecting) and therefore ending up legging it every time the water came back on…..</p>

<p>And now, back to here, stealing wireless from one of the 20 that I’m able to pick up in the area.</p>

<div class="author_meta">05 Apr 2006</div>
<p>Its been a long time without me saying anything much, but lots and lots going on. The first event to note was that I had my car attempted to be broken into over here in Roath, I suppose that eventually that this was bound to happen being in a city centre and all I guess until now I’ve been lucky. They tried to get in through the passenger side door, bending it out and giving up after not getting in. I suppose its good that nothing has been stolen, but more of a worry that it happened directly outside our house and nobody noticed and that I now have a bent-out-bent-back-in version of my door.</p>

<p>Viv and my birthdays happened last month. Strange to think that I’m now 25, closer to 30 than 20 and all that. To kind of celebrate, Viv and I took a weekend in Dublin which just happened to occur just after St Patricks Day, which most definitely was not planned, or thought about. It meant there were a few free attractions going on and a far too great amount of Americans littering the whole area. The first night we got to climb hills and watch a fireworks display, with day two visiting the Evangelical Church around the corner from where we were staying and looking around Dublin in the afternoon. Day 3 was more of the same with Dublin, and a visit to Howth in the afternoon. The weather the whole weekend was fairly pants, with the trip to Howth being amusingly wet. Being the classy fellow I am, I forced Viv to eat the cheapest meals we could find anywhere – I was paying after all, gah! I think KFC, Subway and our midnight outside Chinese bench sit take-out were the meals to note. I also forced us to make use of public transportation the whole way – using two 3 day passes which meant we had the run of the entire city bus services and the Dart line which ran from Brey to Howth (hence the visits to both!). To be honest I managed to get very skint due to being unpaid since December by this point, so my interesting use of the money I took (£70 inc travel whilst there), for the two of us, I thought was pretty good. I even managed to get a subsidised rate for rooms as we were both students (you don’t ask you don’t get!). To be able to translate from pounds to euros also got extremely confusing and may have hindered spending a little bit too.</p>

<p>My actual birthday party I had a pizza and nintendo night, which actually turned more into a bongo fest on donkey kong. Birthday presents have been fairly interesting (including more chocolate raisans and a rather rude t-shirt!). I had far more people turn up than my last birthday – which all of 2 people came to, maybe this was because I staged it at home so housemates were forced to partake.</p>

<p>Last month (on Vivs birthday) I discovered that not only was I to travel to Singapore with work in May, but to Chicago too! This is the source of major stress and excitement, while as I get to go to these wonderful cities, I have to deal with the arrangements for travel myself, whilst preparing what I am actually presenting also. It’s also my first travel outside of the realms of Europe (arrgghhhh, etc, etc). I’ll probably keep people informed of what I’m up to on each trip on here…stay tuned…</p>

<p>It was also another well <a href="http://freelancetheology.typepad.com">known persons birthday</a> last weekend, we celebrated with his family and friends before taking a trip to the park and all act our ages…</p>

<p>I’m always coming up with concepts for websites, but I thought this one was worth blogging about. Basically, my idea is that you give yourself a budget of say 99p on ebay and see what kind of profit you can get from that by selling it again….on ebay… and so on until you flop and lose all your profit, or give up and bag the benefits of being able to spell and take photographs.It might sound stupid, but I believe that there are many key factors which influence the price at which items sell i.e. presentation, description, etc etc. The geeks who are able to make things look pretty and take a few photos might as well take maximum benefit..I went ahead and registered a <a href="http://www.ebayexperiment.com/" title="The Ebay Experiment">domain</a> for it, to hear of others who’d like to give it a go too. I might even start – that is if I can find an item worthy of gaining profit with for 99p!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, I noticed that worpdress.com, org and net weren’t registered, despite their similarity to the excellent blogging tool wordpress’s <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" title="wordpress.org">domain</a>. I thought it was too good an opportunity to be missed, and registered the lot of them.After a couple of posts on the wordpress forums, and the realisation that there was no way in hell I’d ever have the time to put anything there, I decided to donate them to Matt Mullenweg, so at least they were redirecting the one or two people who might hit them to the correct wordpress site.I sent a short email to Matt, whom I didn’t actually expect to reply – but to my surprise he did, and after a bit of searching round on godaddy for domain transferal technique (rather than re-registration), successfully switched them to his command. I hope they are of use to the person whom is technically this sites creator.</p>

<p>I’ve recently, through many searches to do with AJAX, Web 2.0 and the like been perusing <a href="http://digg.com">digg.com</a>, that fairly new web site for geeks.Basically, it’s a social booking marking site where users “digg” those sites which they find interesting, as more users digg the same pages, they get promoted up through to the main page, or higher up through the rankings within particular categories. Its a really interesting concept, quite similar to <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, but mainly centred on techie news, which means I end up reading it forever.The best part I think though is the <a href="http://digg.com/spy">digg spy</a> – which allows you to see (through a fancy ajax system) which diggs are being made right now.As an example of interesting links I’ve found, check out <a href="http://forums.cgsociety.org/showthread.php?t=233460">these insanely realistic renders</a> of various interiors.</p>

<div class="author_meta">02 Mar 2006</div>
<p>Flipping pancakes eh? They’re crafty beggars they are..</p>

<p>Would you believe that in my 24 years knocking around, I’d never actually flipped a pancake until this tuesday? You could understand why I might be a little excited about that particular prospect, and a little nervous. I spent my evening with a bunch of girls, in all shapes and sizes (some tall, some short, some insanely strong) to celebrate this occasion, but when my time to shine came, it was all good. </p>

<p>I wonder if anyone has ever tried to juggle pancakes between two frying pans and three pancakes…could be interesting?</p>
