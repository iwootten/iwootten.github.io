<p>I’ve started a new blog over at <a href="http://www.webtyrant.com">webtyrant.com</a> for all of you who visit my site and need a fix of techie-type jazz. I figured most of you didn’t, hence my placement on a different domain. You might notice a similar theme over there, so that’ll make you feel right at home even if the content doesn’t.</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/02/09/hardware">MSI RS480M2-IL Motherboard</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">09 Feb 2006</div>
<p>For those of you who would like to have a stable SFF machine, lest ye take heed of my advice…do not buy MSI.I bought a mATX MSI RS480M2-IL back in october, with a view to putting it in my new Antec Aria SFF case. It looked deceptively feature packed with its 939 madness and 3 x PCI and PCI-E slots. There it still currently resides sitting quietly all day until I return from work in the evening to perhaps do a little web design or listen to the 70 odd gigs of music I have stashed away. A simple task you might think, but not for MSI, it justs freezes when you least expect it.No amount of BIOS updates or re-configuring of internal cabling will remedy this, instability is an added feature of MSI boards. The best part is, it only crashes during normal windows usage, not hardcore gaming – bizarre….It’s in all honesty the first board I’m thinking of ditching with another and just plain rubbish.</p>

<p>I’ve just been informed that my paper for <a href="http://pdcc.ntu.edu.sg/ccgrid2006/" title="CCGRID06">CCGRID06 </a>has been accepted, which I’m very pleased about. It’s my first paper acceptance in my 14 months of being based as a PhD at Cardiff University so really its about time I got some ideas out in the open to people. It’s also based in Singapore, and I’ve never left Europe – yeah it’s two days, but I’m chuffed nonetheless.</p>

<p>The ironic thing is I was a bit annoyed last year at the fact <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/ccgrid2005/" title="CCGRID05">CCGRID05 </a>was in Cardiff. I suppose its better this way round.</p>

<div class="author_meta">01 Feb 2006</div>
<p>My day was brightened lots yesterday when my my PhD supervisor informed me he had a blog on the subject of grid computing. It was intended for members of our research group to contribute to and discuss things. The most amusing part was, being cutting edge and all, you’d expect it to be a bustling hive of activity. What I actually found was a <a href="http://gridder.blogspot.com/">site</a> with <strong>two posts</strong> covering the last 2 years. Yup, that’ll about do it.</p>

<div class="author_meta">30 Jan 2006</div>
<p>This post is the official 100th post on this site! Wow, how exciting. I know that it’s marked up as #127, but these are of the ones that actually made it public here. The first one made it up back in August 03 and <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install/">was rather boring</a>. That makes an average blog per month rating of 3.4….Yeah, thats lame too. So, what can I talk about to make it all profound now? Hmm…</p>

<p>This week marked 3 months of Viv and I dating. I suppose I’m still finding it all rather bizarre a woman being interested in me in that way – well any way actually! Though she does seem a little confused about which role in the relationship she’d like to take. Anyway, it has been a great time and I wouldn’t change any of it. Actually, thats a lie, I wouldn’t mind changing the part where she didn’t tell me how she felt when I initially spilled my guts, for maybe 6 months, because I actually thought she despised me with a passion – yeah that was a fun time. Rant over, I’m loving it now. This time makes up for a lot of confusion for me back then. Too bad it took her the best part of 25 years to find me.</p>

<p>Did we do anything special? Unfortunately no – distance a problem here and I got so into my work I actually forgot about it by the end of the day and was still at uni a t 8pm working. Ever the hopeless romantic…..ah well save all that for that day next month I guess.</p>

<p>Here’s a strange photo of the two of us, looking a bit rough.</p>

<p>For Christmas, one of my gifts was an ace calendar providing helpful hints on worst case scenarios for each day of 2006. Todays one made me smile quite a lot – “How to survive psychological torture”. The second part of it however sounds more applicable to everyday life, work, relationships etc rather than actual torture (except for the horrors part).</p>

<p>Here’s the advice:</p>

<p>Do not worry about what comes next.<br />
Do not dwell on what just happened.<br />
Deal with each horror on its own terms, as it happens.</p>

<p>I’m thinking if applied to torture it may be slightly more difficult than the calendar makes it seem though…</p>

<h1><a href="/2006/01/14/life-goes-on">Life Goes On</a></h1>
<div class="author_meta">14 Jan 2006</div>
<p>On the dawning of a new year, life continues much the same as it has done previously, I have lots of work to do, lots of pointless things to do and lots of people who want me to fix their computers because they heard I know a little about those sorts of things. On my quest to rid the world of all t-shirts by stocking up on them myself, I’d quite like to pick up <a href="http://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=GADG&amp;title=710114&amp;p=432&amp;g=532&amp;pa=genbrw#" title="Geeky T-Shirts">this t-shirt</a> to reflect how I sometimes feel about this. I may as well not beat around the bush. Although I do occasionally do like to do some alternate computing things in my spare time it seems I end up doing it incessantly, which really makes it a hideous attribute to possess and leaves me with very little free time at all. The period at home over Chistmas really brought this up too. Oh well, I am a geek and am burdened with the full package which comes with it.</p>

<div class="author_meta">05 Jan 2006</div>
<p>I’ve not spoken in a long time on here and it seems I’m getting harassed into doing so, so I thought I’d air some stuff.</p>

<p>It’s the New Year! Woohoo! Christmas brought with it all the usual stuff, like parents moaning about computers and arguing about nothing. This year I only crept back for a very short time in which to see family and catch up. It seems like Yeovil is less and less like my home now, with friends moving away and all. I didn’t really get to see anyone much, but did spy Mike and Nathans new houses while I was back. Its really strange to see people moving forward in that respect, their places seem huge, but then they’ve been working forever – did I take the wrong track? What would my life be like if?, are questions I constantly ask myself…</p>

<p>I spent lots of time doing various holiday type things…went away for New Year to <a href="http://peacehaven.org.uk/">Sidmouth, Devon</a>. I managed to tow Viv along as well although she did just sleep through most of everything. She was feeling a bit poorly so was left to sleep that off, but then you have to add the normal sleep regime as well, so thats a whole lotta sleeping. We got a bit confusled on the beach and accidentally lost everyone in a big cave – which there was talk of spending New Year in, but I think the weather didn’t really cater for this. I didn’t ever see it but apparently it was quite spectacular. Viv quite cleverly fell asleep on said beach, I got lots of weird looks from bypassers (presumeably wondering what on earth I’d done….) and a dog almost thought she was a tree…and then it rained….hard.</p>

<p>Also been spending time with the Matthias’, joking having a laugh etc, etc. It’s been ace, I even benefited to the tune of 3 next tops by playing Mario and letting females go off and guess sizes (they guessed Jon’s size poorly). We’ve fed ducks in the sunset, thrown stones at beaches and tried to kill one another via remote sumo over the last month. Good times.</p>

<p>This time of year usually marks a milestone of some sort in terms of relection, but I shant ponder too much right now. Suffice to say I’m hopeful and really excited, so am looking forward to it. I guess the only reality check right now is the mountain of work ahead to wade through. Roll on the weekend.</p>
