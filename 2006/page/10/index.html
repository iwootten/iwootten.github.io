          <p>So despite having only been back in the UK for less than a week, I&#8217;m now off to Singapore, to present another paper of my work at CCGrid06. I&#8217;m slightly less nervewracked this time, but not looking forward to the ridiculous flight time (best part of 13 hours) and the time difference when I arrive (+ 7 hours). Viv tells me its a beautiful and amazingly techie place, so it sounds not at all distant from my own bedroom.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try and post more as and when I have interesting stuff to report!</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2006</div>

          <p>So today marks the last day I&#8217;m put up in the Hard Rock, and my last full day here in the states. I awoke to a bill that had been slipped under my door to announce that I&#8217;d been charged for their &#8220;intimacy kit&#8221;, because I had moved it to have a look at it, and this constitutes a charge. I found this most amusing. I think I&#8217;ll make sure that there are no more automated charges made before I leave, seeing as how I&#8217;ve actually used nothing&#8230;.</p>
<p>Anyway, tonight I am hopefully off to see the mighty <a href="http://djatrak.com/">A-Trak</a> at the Empty Bottle here in Chicago. It should be fairly awesome I&#8217;ll let you know what happens later, if I can ever reach the place.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">06 May 2006</div>

          <p>After the workshop ended in the early hours of the afternoon today, I thought it would be kinda cool to head over and see if I could find threadless in Chicago, to stock up on some more of their awesome t shirts. After a little bit of thinking and umming and ahh-ing about whether or not I could actually find the place, I decided to make a a go of it and try.</p>
<p>A short train ride later, I found the offices of skinnycorp, and got shown round the whole setup, introduced to peeps and given some of those oh so amusing &#8220;i park like an idiot&#8221; stickers. It was kinda surreal to see all these people whole acted as models on the website in real life. Charlie showed me around the place..you can lots of vids of the guy (bearded, glasses, boxed) over at <a href="http://www.craigshimala.com">Craig Shimala&#8217;s</a> web site.</p>
<p>I also got the experience of going to see the whitesox today&#8230;even though they scored 3 home runs, they didn&#8217;t win, but the fireworks at the end were amazing! You can see me, Steve and Paul over on the <a href="http://www.printroom.com/ViewGalleryPhoto.asp?userid=wsfanfoto&#038;gallery_id=377846&#038;image_id=27">sox site</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">05 May 2006</div>

          <p>Hello. Today marked the second day in the workshop I&#8217;m attending and the presentation of some of my own work and thoughts. I&#8217;ve also experienced some very useful thoughts of not only my work, but my PhD as a whole. Today is a good day for that.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening we attended an italian restaurant as part of the evening meals for the conference, which featured such a ridulous amount of food it was stupid. We had less people on our table, and it meant that actually we would end up with more than a dish each &#8211; 1 1/2 plates each full to the brim. Twas nice&#8230;</p>
<p>I also managed to finally get to experience Chicago Downtown pizza, which is something which has to be done apparently. Prior to this also, I managed to get an experience of drinking in a bar looking atop one of the smaller buildings in the area. Have a look at the pic for an idea of what it looked like.</p>

          <p>So today marked the checking in and out of hotels to move down the road in preparation for my workshop I&#8217;m attending while I&#8217;m here. Here&#8217;s some views of my hotel room looking out onto Sears, complete with the only person whom is here with me. I have to head out now, for the conference dinner etc. I shall be sure to post later.</p>
