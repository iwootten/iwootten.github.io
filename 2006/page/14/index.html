          <p>This post is the official 100th post on this site! Wow, how exciting. I know that it&#8217;s marked up as #127, but these are of the ones that actually made it public here. The first one made it up back in August 03 and <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2003/08/14/blog-install/">was rather boring</a>. That makes an average blog per month rating of 3.4&#8230;.Yeah, thats lame too. So, what can I talk about to make it all profound now? Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>This week marked 3 months of Viv and I dating. I suppose I&#8217;m still finding it all rather bizarre a woman being interested in me in that way &#8211; well any way actually! Though she does seem a little confused about which role in the relationship she&#8217;d like to take. Anyway, it has been a great time and I wouldn&#8217;t change any of it. Actually, thats a lie, I wouldn&#8217;t mind changing the part where she didn&#8217;t tell me how she felt when I initially spilled my guts, for maybe 6 months, because I actually thought she despised me with a passion &#8211; yeah that was a fun time. Rant over, I&#8217;m loving it now. This time makes up for a lot of confusion for me back then. Too bad it took her the best part of 25 years to find me.</p>
<p>Did we do anything special? Unfortunately no &#8211; distance a problem here and I got so into my work I actually forgot about it by the end of the day and was still at uni a t 8pm working. Ever the hopeless romantic&#8230;..ah well save all that for that day next month I guess.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a strange photo of the two of us, looking a bit rough.</p>

          <p>For Christmas, one of my gifts was an ace calendar providing helpful hints on worst case scenarios for each day of 2006. Todays one made me smile quite a lot &#8211; &#8220;How to survive psychological torture&#8221;. The second part of it however sounds more applicable to everyday life, work, relationships etc rather than actual torture (except for the horrors part).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the advice:</p>
<p>Do not worry about what comes next.<br>Do not dwell on what just happened.<br>Deal with each horror on its own terms, as it happens.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking if applied to torture it may be slightly more difficult than the calendar makes it seem though&#8230;</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Jan 2006</div>

          <p>On the dawning of a new year, life continues much the same as it has done previously, I have lots of work to do, lots of pointless things to do and lots of people who want me to fix their computers because they heard I know a little about those sorts of things. On my quest to rid the world of all t-shirts by stocking up on them myself, I&#8217;d quite like to pick up <a href="http://www.play.com/play247.asp?page=title&amp;r=GADG&amp;title=710114&amp;p=432&amp;g=532&amp;pa=genbrw#" title="Geeky T-Shirts">this t-shirt</a> to reflect how I sometimes feel about this. I may as well not beat around the bush. Although I do occasionally do like to do some alternate computing things in my spare time it seems I end up doing it incessantly, which really makes it a hideous attribute to possess and leaves me with very little free time at all. The period at home over Chistmas really brought this up too. Oh well, I am a geek and am burdened with the full package which comes with it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">05 Jan 2006</div>

          <p>I&#8217;ve not spoken in a long time on here and it seems I&#8217;m getting harassed into doing so, so I thought I&#8217;d air some stuff.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the New Year! Woohoo! Christmas brought with it all the usual stuff, like parents moaning about computers and arguing about nothing. This year I only crept back for a very short time in which to see family and catch up. It seems like Yeovil is less and less like my home now, with friends moving away and all. I didn&#8217;t really get to see anyone much, but did spy Mike and Nathans new houses while I was back. Its really strange to see people moving forward in that respect, their places seem huge, but then they&#8217;ve been working forever &#8211; did I take the wrong track? What would my life be like if?, are questions I constantly ask myself&#8230;</p>
<p>I spent lots of time doing various holiday type things&#8230;went away for New Year to <a href="http://peacehaven.org.uk/">Sidmouth, Devon</a>. I managed to tow Viv along as well although she did just sleep through most of everything. She was feeling a bit poorly so was left to sleep that off, but then you have to add the normal sleep regime as well, so thats a whole lotta sleeping. We got a bit confusled on the beach and accidentally lost everyone in a big cave &#8211; which there was talk of spending New Year in, but I think the weather didn&#8217;t really cater for this. I didn&#8217;t ever see it but apparently it was quite spectacular. Viv quite cleverly fell asleep on said beach, I got lots of weird looks from bypassers (presumeably wondering what on earth I&#8217;d done&#8230;.) and a dog almost thought she was a tree&#8230;and then it rained&#8230;.hard.</p>
<p>Also been spending time with the Matthias&#8217;, joking having a laugh etc, etc. It&#8217;s been ace, I even benefited to the tune of 3 next tops by playing Mario and letting females go off and guess sizes (they guessed Jon&#8217;s size poorly). We&#8217;ve fed ducks in the sunset, thrown stones at beaches and tried to kill one another via remote sumo over the last month. Good times.</p>
<p>This time of year usually marks a milestone of some sort in terms of relection, but I shant ponder too much right now. Suffice to say I&#8217;m hopeful and really excited, so am looking forward to it. I guess the only reality check right now is the mountain of work ahead to wade through. Roll on the weekend.</p>
