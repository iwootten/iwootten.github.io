    <p>I&#8217;ve not spoken in a long time on here and it seems I&#8217;m getting harassed into doing so, so I thought I&#8217;d air some stuff.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the New Year! Woohoo! Christmas brought with it all the usual stuff, like parents moaning about computers and arguing about nothing. This year I only crept back for a very short time in which to see family and catch up. It seems like Yeovil is less and less like my home now, with friends moving away and all. I didn&#8217;t really get to see anyone much, but did spy Mike and Nathans new houses while I was back. Its really strange to see people moving forward in that respect, their places seem huge, but then they&#8217;ve been working forever &#8211; did I take the wrong track? What would my life be like if?, are questions I constantly ask myself&#8230;</p>

<p>I spent lots of time doing various holiday type things&#8230;went away for New Year to <a href="http://peacehaven.org.uk/">Sidmouth, Devon</a>. I managed to tow Viv along as well although she did just sleep through most of everything. She was feeling a bit poorly so was left to sleep that off, but then you have to add the normal sleep regime as well, so thats a whole lotta sleeping. We got a bit confusled on the beach and accidentally lost everyone in a big cave &#8211; which there was talk of spending New Year in, but I think the weather didn&#8217;t really cater for this. I didn&#8217;t ever see it but apparently it was quite spectacular. Viv quite cleverly fell asleep on said beach, I got lots of weird looks from bypassers (presumeably wondering what on earth I&#8217;d done&#8230;.) and a dog almost thought she was a tree&#8230;and then it rained&#8230;.hard.</p>

<p>Also been spending time with the Matthias&#8217;, joking having a laugh etc, etc. It&#8217;s been ace, I even benefited to the tune of 3 next tops by playing Mario and letting females go off and guess sizes (they guessed Jon&#8217;s size poorly). We&#8217;ve fed ducks in the sunset, thrown stones at beaches and tried to kill one another via remote sumo over the last month. Good times.</p>

<p>This time of year usually marks a milestone of some sort in terms of relection, but I shant ponder too much right now. Suffice to say I&#8217;m hopeful and really excited, so am looking forward to it. I guess the only reality check right now is the mountain of work ahead to wade through. Roll on the weekend.</p>
