      <description>Woohoo, rock on &amp;#8211; its almost holiday season for me. Next week I&amp;#8217;ll be off to Scotland to the Isle of Mull for a week and a bit of unadulterated relaxing. Ahh&amp;#8230;Looking forward to it. Last years summer time in France was one of the best times I&amp;#8217;ve had in donkeys and I hope and expect this to be too. So to those who&amp;#8217;ll be there with me &amp;#8211; you best make it a good&amp;#8217;n.</description>

      <description>Currently, I&amp;#8217;ve been spending many an hour pondering domain name choices for a fair trade t-shirt site I&amp;#8217;d like to set-up, but never actually committing to one, due to the rather lacklustre responses of others on hearing my suggestions, or not finding anything suitable which conveys what I am trying to get across (a hip, trendy t-shirt place, ala threadless.com).If anyone can think of anything clever &amp;#8211; let me know.</description>

      <description>Interestingly, two of my most used sites hotmail and ebay, seem to be unavailable at the moment for me to peruse in my daily late night browsing routine. Maybe ntl is doing something stupid at the moment, in fact this is most likely the problem as large amounts of images around the web are unable to be displayed for one reason or another.</description>
