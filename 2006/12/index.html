      <div class="author_meta">21 Dec 2006</div>

          <p>Apparently, according to the free English dictionary there is a couple of definitions other than the traditional UK understanding of the word pantomime. For those international readers who don&#8217;t know, a pantomime is a pretty awful example of B-List celebrities acting ability in the UK in which involves them dressing up in bad costumes and acting out a fairy tale or story. In Cardiff, the big panto is Jack and the Giant Beanstalk &#8211; where Jack is played by <a href="http://www.newtheatrecardiff.co.uk/English/whatson_detail.asp?ID=187">John Barrowman</a> (or Captain Jack from Torchwood and Dr Who). The other definition is: &#8216;The telling of a story without words, by means of bodily movements, gestures, and facial expressions.&#8217;.Sam Sethi has been in the <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/12/14/sam-sethi-is-sacked-from-techcrunch-uk/">news</a> <a href="http://webtyrant.com/2006/12/14/sam-sethi-has-nowhere-to-blog/">recently</a> with articles reporting on his departure from TechcrunchUK. <a href="http://samsethi.glaxstar.com/?p=30">Sam has recently called</a> Mike Arrington&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crunchnotes.com/?p=327">interpretation of events</a> a bit of a pantomime, with a lot of &#8220;oh no it isn&#8217;t&#8221;, &#8220;oh yes it is&#8221; type comments going on. The whole scenario has rolled on for a while now and definitely does not conform to the second interpretation of a pantomime. My only wish was that the original intention for the Techcrunch sites, i.e to report on web start-ups, be it in Europe or elsewhere remained the primary concern for them, and I didn&#8217;t have to be subjected to the arguments that editors of such blogs may have with one another. Then again, I may be perpetuating the whole ordeal by writing this post&#8230;.</p>

          <p>Apparently <a href="http://virtualnick.vox.com/library/post/what-happens-to-your-body-if-you-drink-a-coke-right-now.html">coke isn&#8217;t that good for you</a> &#8211; a few of my friends might like to take heed of that advice. <a href="http://www.eepybird.com/exp214.html">But, you can do some cool things with a lot of it</a>.</p>

          <p>Digg.com is sporting the ability to be able to now rate online video and podcasts. Postcast searching is in limited beta for registered users only.I just spent a while perusing some items of interest, and found a great segment of <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8169033819829939284&#038;hl=en">play</a>! over on google. This just builds on the fact that Mario has the most awesome music ever.The searching of podcasts is dangerously close to an idea I&#8217;ve currently working on myself for a while now. Maybe I should get on with it.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">14 Dec 2006</div>

          <p><a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch UK</a>, <a href="http://techcrunch.com">Techcrunch&#8217;s</a> european sister site has recently had a lot of activiity from <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/12/11/le-web3-the-good-bad-and-ugly/">some notes</a> which the editor at the time, Sam Sethi made about the recent <a href="http://leweb3.com">leweb3</a> event.This invited some comments from Six Apartâ€™s Loic Le Meur in which he called Sam &#8220;an asshole&#8221;. Sam subsequently posted another blog about the fact that TechcrunchUK would be setting up its own events and workshops in the forthcoming year. It seems this displeased techcrunch&#8217;s Mike Arrington enough to give Sam the boot. The TechcrunchUK site has since been put on hold.I enjoyed TechcrunchUK&#8217;s insight into the UK world of web 2.0, I sorely hope this does not signal its end.</p>

          <p>It seems, according to <a href="http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/index.php/2006/12/13/six-apart-removes-sam-sethis-typepad-account/">Ben Metcalfe</a>, that Sam Sethi has had <a href="http://samsethi.typepad.com">his typepad account</a> disabled by Six Apart, rendering him unable to post any updates on his recent departure from TechcrunchUK. <a href="http://www.loiclemeur.com/">Loic Le Meur</a> (Executive Vice President of Six Apart and General Manager of Europe, Middle East and Africa) is currently giving no information about the whole scenario upon his own blog.UPDATE: Apparently Sam Sethi&#8217;s blog is up and running, though he has to yet confirm this and post his take on the whole scenario.</p>
