    <p><a href="http://fakeyourspace.com"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>I heard about <a href="http://www.fakeyourspace.com">fakeyourspace</a> via <a href="http://mashable.com/2006/11/30/fakeyourspace-launches-buy-sexy-myspace-friends/">mashable</a> today, which offers the ability to purchase your own social networking friends to leave messages and comments on communities such as myspace and facebook (the only two web pages I ever see to be open when supervising university labs). In their own words:*“If you are tired of seeing everyone else with the hottest friends and want some hotties of your own, then this is the place for you.”*For the princely sum of $1.99 – or $0.99 as an introductory offer, you can purchase a friend to leave you two comments on your profile per week. The photo’s seem to all rather fake, as their name would suggest.I would give you some more stats, but it seems that fakeyourspace is either suffering from the mashable effect (being mashed?), or indeed that its been pulled for being completely and utterly ridiculous. I wouldn’t be surprised if myspace or facebook had been on their backs in order to cut the kind of fake networking that such a system would introduce. They could easily kill each of the profiles which had been created on any of their networks if not.</p>
