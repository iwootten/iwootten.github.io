    <p>It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that I <a href="http://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/10/13/ow-my-arse">posted about coming off of my bike</a> due to a slippery road, but this time was a bit different. Today somebody properly smacked me off of my bike! They were attempting to cut round a light-enabled junction when the lights had gone green in a different direction. As there is a small window of time only 1 or two generally make this turn, but this car decided that it should go even if it wasn&#8217;t its turn. They wheelspun out and clipped my backwheel, kicking my bike out from under me. I promptly leapt to my feet and gave them a whole host of verbal abuse in the middle of the road, before going to meet them where they pulled in. There I explained to them (throught the art of shouting) why attempting the turn was difficult (you are essentially doing a 180 degree turn) and ridiculous when it was the crossing traffic&#8217;s right of way. Their excuses were rather pathetic to say the least, and I told them that even if they &#8216;didn&#8217;t know the area&#8217;, that this should prompt some caution and mowing down cyclists wasn&#8217;t the way to go to make friends.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t believe some people, this is the first time I&#8217;ve physically been struck by a vehicle and was a really stupid mistake.</p>
