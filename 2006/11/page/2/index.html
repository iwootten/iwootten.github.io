          <p><a href="http://www.carsonsystems.com">Carson Systems</a> <a href="http://dropsend.com">DropSend</a> has recently been put up for sale by Ryan Carson. He states that currently they don&#8217;t have enough time to give it the attention it deserves, although the application is profitable with customers accumulating month by month.<img id="image25" src="http://webtyrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/11/dropsendlogo.gif" alt="DropSend" /><a href="http://dropsend.com">DropSend</a> allows users to email huge files to one another via uploading them to dropsend and sending an email to the reciever to detail where it can be collected from. It&#8217;s quite interesting as the costs involved in its building are quite detailed within <a href="http://www.webuser.co.uk/carsonworkshops/RyanCarson.mp3">Ryans talk</a> at a previous <a href="http://www.carsonworkshops.com/summit/">Future of Web Apps conference</a> (also broken down <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_cost_of_bootstrapping_your_app_the_figures_behind_dropsend_part_one_.php">here at 37 signals</a>). For those who are interested, it cost around Â£26k. It will be good to see what kind of profit the team is able to achieve.You can read about DropSends sale progress over at their <a href="http://barenakedapp.com">barenakedapp</a> website, which previously was used to divulge the details of the building of their most recent project, <a href="http://heyamigo.net">amigo</a>.</p>

      <div class="author_meta">03 Nov 2006</div>

          <p>Our front room is looking a bit of a technology graveyard at the moment. Not only do we have the two archaic computers which have been there since forever, but now we also sport an unused fridge which has been replaced by one of our housemates parents (much larger) hand-me-downs.</p>
<p>This time last year saw the cleaning out of the Cardiff Department of Computer Science&#8217;s cupboards, with a large amount of the machines having to be &#8220;properly disposed of&#8221;, due to their burden of having huge crt monitors from yesteryear. Presumeably this means they are taken to be properly disassembled and resused if possible &#8211; somewhere like <a href="http://www.wastechnique.com/">wastechnique</a> in wales for example. When it was suggested that they be offered to charities who would re-use the machines sent to third world countries and the like, the idea was rejected because the scheme had never been attempted before.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite crazy how disposable technology has become in modern life. I suppose I notice it more now due to having that much more of it myself, I have 3 past mobile phones in my possession currently, not counting those back in Yeovil. I wonder what little gadgets we&#8217;ll be chucking out 10, 20 years down the line&#8230;..</p>
