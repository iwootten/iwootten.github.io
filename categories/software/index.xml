      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s some features I found interesting in the release of Python 3.9 last month. You can see me talk about each of these in my latest video on youtube.
Full Release Notes
Merging and Updating Dictionaries From PEP 584 - Dictionaries now have new union operators to work with them.
Python 3.8:
x = {&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;original_value&amp;#39;} y = {&amp;#39;key&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;updated_value&amp;#39;} print({**x, **y}) # Python 3.8 unpacking, kind of confusing Python 3.</description>

      <title>Use Black to Format Python and get on with Your Life</title>

      <description>When I first started working in software development teams, I can remember heated discussions on pull requests on a few occasions. Typically these were when I or other developers reviewed code that didn&amp;rsquo;t meet formatting rules that were felt best for that piece of work. It didn&amp;rsquo;t matter whether the rules in question were in code, documented in a README or just held in a developers head, the simple fact that something was wrong on the project meant the author needed to make changes, be severely reprimanded and never make the mistake again.</description>

      <title>How to Deploy a Django App to the DigitalOcean App Platform</title>

      <description>Digitalocean recently launched their App platform, a platform as a service (PaaS) which can be seen as a competitor to the likes of Heroku. As a Python developer, I wanted to see how easy it was to deploy a django app to App platform. It took me a little while to configure everything correctly so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d go through some of the points that tripped me up here.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for some time for a relatively simple method for deploying my projects, but I also want to use a pattern where my repo is the primary source of truth for my app.</description>

      <title>Publishing to PyPI Using Github Actions</title>

      <description>In creating my first package on PyPI, I realised that many of the tasks I&amp;rsquo;d want to do on a subsequent publish would be repetitive. If I wanted to push out a simple fix, I wanted to automate away those tasks so I could focus on my code rather than a sequence of repetitive steps.
Github actions is a simple way to do this and has given me the ability to quickly push out changes without lots of manual work.</description>

      <title>Publishing a Package to PyPI with Poetry</title>

      <description>I recently published my first ever package to the Python Package Index (PyPI). The process was particularly novel for me as it meant my first ever use of the Poetry package management tool. If you happen to work in a production studio that uses ftrack and is now working remotely, you might even want to take a look at it as it enables sharing of assets using the Simple Storage Service (S3) from Amazon Web Services.</description>

      <title>My Web Development Stack in 2018</title>

      <description>Over my time as a web developer, I’ve jumped between many frameworks and languages, attempting to find ones that work well for me. This seems to be pretty typical for developers who always have a take on the latest trend, either to quickly adopt or criticise it.
I really wanted to be a member of the Ruby crew for a time and ended up buying multiple copies of “Agile Web Development with Rails”, before having the opportunity to really apply it to a project and disposing of them because the material was outdated.</description>

      <title>User Generated Forms with WTForms</title>

      <description>As part of my past work with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I worked with the survey runner team to add additional features to their Electronic Questionnaire which enabled the business to take regular surveys electronically via the web. During my final months there, I took it upon myself to tackle what was seen to be one of the projects major pieces of technical debt, its use of a custom form renderer.</description>

      <title>Processing Camera RAWs with OpenImageIO and Python</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2014/09/15/processing-camera-raws-with-openimageio-and-python/</link>

      <description>I recently discovered the library OpenImageIO, an awesome tool for reading and writing image files. What makes this of particular interest is the sheer variety of image files supported (BMP, Cineon, JPG, JPG-2000, GIF, DPX, OpenEXR, Targa, TIFF) (as well as variety of camera raw formats) and the fact it can perform image transformations upon them very easily. Given it&amp;rsquo;s designed for use in media and VFX environments it sounds like it will be useful for the type of work I&amp;rsquo;ve previously been involved with in stop motion.</description>

      <description>Recently, Andy Davies asked the following question on twitter: Any ideas on how I can easily convert a video to a filmstrip?
&amp;mdash; Andy Davies (@AndyDavies) July 23, 2014  I found this pretty interesting, especially given I&amp;rsquo;d used various open source tools for assembling storyboards in the past. I knew it was possible to extract images at desired intervals and left it as that.
After a bit of digging last night, I discovered it&amp;rsquo;s actually possible to extract images based on changes in the video.</description>
