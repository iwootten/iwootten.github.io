      <title>Shipping in March: Week 1</title>

      <description>I promised a progress update on how my attempt to get 4 projects shipped this month was going. On my first week, I decided to focus on my time tracking tool, hourglass. I&amp;#8217;ve had this in the works for sometime and unfortunately, it&amp;#8217;s fallen by the wayside to client work.
I&amp;#8217;ve failed on my first week in getting this released to the world, but I&amp;#8217;m far happier with how it&amp;#8217;s working now and the value it might give to any potential user than previously.</description>

      <description>This month, I&amp;#8217;ve decided to take some time out to ship projects.
I have a huge list of projects accumulating I&amp;#8217;d like to push out of the door, but as a father and freelancer I have lack of a certain commodity in able to achieve them. That would be time.
Currently I don&amp;#8217;t have any work booked in for a while, so along with Viv, we&amp;#8217;ve decided I should try and get some of these projects released.</description>

      <title>New T-Shirts from Fair &amp; Bare</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2008/11/20/new-t-shirts-from-fair--bare/</link>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m really pleased to announce that Fair &amp;#038; Bare has just released 2 new shirts. First up is “Feel the Force” based on a slogan submission by JonnyDanger and secondly is the fantastic Esther Aarts’ “My Bike is My Castle”. 

We printed these on super-soft, Fairtrade certified, organic in-conversion cotton using fantastic waterbased inks. They also look pretty darn good. It&amp;#8217;s the net result of a ton of hard work by our printers, designers, community and the original cotton original farmers that mean that these have been able to be released.</description>

      <title>UK Jobs in Web 2.0</title>

      <description>If anyone else like me is considering working in the uk &amp;#8220;web 2.0&amp;#8243; market, and finds the posts on common job boards clogged up with all the jobs from america, the small job board I have created and posted online might be a help. You&amp;#8217;ll find it over at: http://webtyrant.com/jobs. It aggregates some common job boards together like 37Signals and ThinkVitamin, but removes anything but those located in the UK.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve started a new blog over at webtyrant.com for all of you who visit my site and need a fix of techie-type jazz. I figured most of you didn&amp;#8217;t, hence my placement on a different domain. You might notice a similar theme over there, so that&amp;#8217;ll make you feel right at home even if the content doesn&amp;#8217;t.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;m realling struggling at the moment to get a visual interface all sorted and loverly so people can literally &amp;#8220;point-and-click&amp;#8221;. I made the decision to do this after talks with both my supervisor and moderator and have been trying like crazy to get it sorted, its taken over a week so far! Not good.
My moderator also suggested that trying to find example XML schemas for CMS&amp;#8217;s which were already out on the market at the moment for would make for good reading also.</description>

      <description>Just realised that my cms doesn&amp;#8217;t display properly in IE6. Might explain why it looked so dodgy at my mid-year meeting with my supervisor.
Got a few extra things in my project, permission system is fully functional, priorities for roles, workflow management &amp;#8211; all of which still have bugs. Going to get down to the actual &amp;#8220;management&amp;#8221; part of the CMS tomorrow.</description>

      <title>What a waste</title>

      <description>What a waste of a day that was&amp;#8230;I hate programming.
I&amp;#8217;ve spent most of the day stuck on trivial little tasks like trying to pass back multi-dimensional arrays through scripts, and interpret the results.
On an upside, I&amp;#8217;ve managed to get XSL producing XHTML output and generated a working grid for the actions in the system. I also found a bug in XSL which means that it will condense textarea tags to their smallest form, and resulting in incorrect display in most web browsers.</description>

      <description>After spending most of the day working upon it, I have managed to convert the whole template system in my project over to XML. I also added the beginnings of a permissions system which has no functionality yet.
This does need some time for me to go through the motions of Spec, Design, Implementation write-up for this over the weekend so that I can present it next week during my mid-year progress presentation with my project supervisor.</description>

      <title>XML, XSLT</title>
      <link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2004/01/28/xml-xslt/</link>

      <guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2004/01/28/xml-xslt/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve spent a large portion of today converting bits of my project over to using XML with XSLT stylesheets. This solves a few issues that I&amp;#8217;d had problems with.
 Generating RSS feeds.
 The masses of files for each template is now reduced to a single XSLT file, easily modified by anyone knowing what they are doing.
 Better compliance with web standards (missing &amp;#8220;&amp;#8216;s, closing tags all need to be corrected) means that it should be relatively XHTML compliant when tested.</description>

      <description>After having been working like theres no tomorrow on other coursework, I&amp;#8217;ve finally managed to come back to my project work.
I&amp;#8217;ve really not got very much productive work done on it aside from a few class diagrams and workflow routines which I&amp;#8217;ve put together. I have been working on a prototype over the last month however in order to have that side of things produced on time. Currently it doesn&amp;#8217;t do a lot more than add or delete users and needs to come a lot further before its something impressive which is worthy to be shown to my supervisor.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to make some headway on my cms project today in order to get ahead and not end up in the same situation as I had in the second year. Seeing as I have a distinct lack of all things coursework related at the mo, I thought that would be a diamond idea. Unfortunately my knowledge of what now goes into a project is somewhat sparse, and I&amp;#8217;m finding it a right job knowing where to tackle first.</description>

      <title>And so it begins..</title>

      <description>Used today (yesterday, actually) to take a look over the various things that can be done when using XML and XLST together. All in all it seems very impressive, and can hugely alter the way which a document may first be formatted. This may be a valid reason to choose this method over more standard CSS techniques, which generally just alter bog standard settings like color, font-size &amp;#8230;.
On a side note, I also managed to get an NT install of CVS sorted and working nicely on my machine.</description>
