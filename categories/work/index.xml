      <description>So here we are in a brand new year. 2012 came and went without even the slightest apocalypse. Reflecting on what has been achieved this past year has found favour with others in the web profession so I thought I might try it. More importantly to me, it also seems like a good way to perhaps spur me on to achieve some firm targets this year.
My circumstances have dramatically changed since January last year.</description>

      <description>In order for me to generate this post I&amp;#8217;ve created something quite novel on my blog &amp;#8211; a new category which I&amp;#8217;ve not had a great deal of experience in previously, &amp;#8220;work&amp;#8221;. For the last couple of months I&amp;#8217;ve been working for Aardman features in Bristol on their forthcoming feature film, &amp;#8220;Pirates&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; building software, which I&amp;#8217;ll be doing at least for the next couple of months too.
I&amp;#8217;ve been having an amazing experience over this time.</description>
