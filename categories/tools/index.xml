I’ve also converted shedloads of photos over so that peeps can see what I’ve been up to recently and not so recently. This includes most of the weddings I’ve attended over the last few years of very close friends, plus a few random ones for good measure.

What I will say though is that I’ve just discovered a sourceforge project called “Ming” which allows for easy SWF (Flash) output with php.
This could come in really handy in that it could be used to generate templates with animated content, such as recent additions or news feeds in side blocks.</description></item></channel></rss>
