      <description>I found with a new poetry install that it refused to use the pyenv version of Python.
I needed to explicitly tell Poetry where to find the active pyenv:
poetry env use -- $(which python) After this, it works as expected.

      <description>When running some Cypress tests in Github Actions that were inspecting dates recently, I wanted to be able to set the locale of the browser - specifically for Chrome which I was using with Cypress.
The tests checked the date format of dd/mm/yyyy and ran fine locally in my own locale of Great Britain, but when my Github action workflow executed them they appeared in a mm/dd/yyyy format.
Originally, I’d thought this require a step within setting up the github action environment itself which set my linux box to have the appropriate locale, but this doesn’t change anything - presumably because the Cypress github action runs in a separate step.</description>

      <description>If you’re using vues router to link to dynamic URLs you may get stuck wondering why your props on router-links aren’t being sent to your components. Vue’s router doesn’t support sending props directly. So you can’t do something like this:
&amp;lt;router-link class=&amp;#34;...&amp;#34; :to=&amp;#34;{ path: `/user/edit/`, id=id }&amp;#34; &amp;gt;Edit &amp;lt;/router-link&amp;gt; Here the id prop will never get passed in routers default configuration. Instead you need to configure each of your routes to pass the route params as props like so:</description>

      <description>I love Poetry, but one thing I always find frustrating is having to add an additional package to my environments to read from .env files and access them as environment variables. I quite often default to Pipenv for simple projects to get round this. Turns out there’s now another way.
Poetry 1.2 will add plugin support to tweak or add to it&amp;rsquo;s default package management behaviour and @mpeteuil made one for .</description>
