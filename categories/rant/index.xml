Check out the following weekly email I used to receive (I’ve since unsubscribed), along with my annotations.
I really couldn’t care less about who lovefilm are sending into cinema’s to perform reviews and certainly don’t want it to be the first text I see in relation to that image.</description></item><item><title>You’re Nowhere Near as Good a Hacker as You Think</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/08/13/youre-nowhere-near-as-good-a-hacker-as-you-think/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/08/13/youre-nowhere-near-as-good-a-hacker-as-you-think/</guid><description>What are you doing? Why would you go down that road? Shouldn’t you be building something else? How long have you been doing this?
Sure you can fool your clients into thinking you’re adding value to their product. I know the truth. But how did you – with all your expertise get to the point in thinking that’s what you’re really doing?
This is your first project? Shouldn’t you be focusing on your clients problems?</description></item><item><title>Goodbye 1 &amp; 1</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/01/12/goodbye-1-1/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2012/01/12/goodbye-1-1/</guid><description>I just sent the following email to 1 � 1′s billing department. I’ve been with them for coming up to 7 years now and they were, when I first used them, the only registraar I knew about and I was really happy.
As the number of domains I own has grown, their account admin has become really totally useless to manage them all. I recieved a payment request out of the blue today and it tipped me over the edge.</description></item><item><title>On Demand Access</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/11/19/on-demand-access/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2006 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2006/11/19/on-demand-access/</guid><description>I don’t really understand microsoft, over the last few days, their live network has been experiencing problems every time I’ve tried to logon to access my email. Who knows what my 8 emails contain which are hidden within live mail, I certainly don’t. You would think that more people would be in uproar about this – I mean what if these were payment requests, final demands or quick response business proposals?</description></item><item><title>EMuppets</title><link>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/11/03/emuppets/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Nov 2005 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.ianwootten.co.uk/2005/11/03/emuppets/</guid><description>So, I’ve had not a lot of response to my situation with ebuyer of late, but this recent email I recieved from them sent me over the edge – I’d sent them 7 emails and phoned 2 times with a 40 min wait prior to recieving this.
