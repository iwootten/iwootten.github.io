      <description>So Apple announces this week that they release their new version of iTunes, the ROKR E1 &amp;#8211; a mobile phone featuring iTunes and finally, the iPod nano &amp;#8211; a super-small, thinner version of the iPod to replace the iPod mini. Another iPod &amp;#8211; how many have there been now? There&amp;#8217;s still no move on a larger capacity front, so nowhere to house my 7000 high quality mp3&amp;#8242;s just yet &amp;#8211; except my portable fat hard drive.</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve had quite a lot of talks recently with people about the subject of piracy, be it music, films, software, whatever. You might think that being a Computer Scientist and DJ, that I&amp;#8217;d be quite blase attitude toward it, but it&amp;#8217;s quite the opposite really.
My take on it, is, whichever way you come at it, it&amp;#8217;s theft. That might sound quite harsh, but I might as well to cut to the chase.</description>

      <description>One of the things I found most amusing yesterday, which made me laugh lots is that my website is currently ranked #5 in msn for &amp;#8220;childrens farting jokes&amp;#8221;, Microsoft are obviously doing their jobs well once again.</description>
