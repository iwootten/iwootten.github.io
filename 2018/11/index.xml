      <description>As we nearing Christmas, we’re met with the familiar annual trickle of uplifting, heartwarming adverts that show just how wonderful your world will be if only you would buy your gifts from a particular retailer. After several weeks of this I’m already feeling bad for thinking our simple, paired down family Christmas experience might just not compare and wondering how anyone can’t help but feel any different after two months of constant commercial brainwashing.</description>

      <description>Over my time as a web developer, I’ve jumped between many frameworks and languages, attempting to find ones that work well for me. This seems to be pretty typical for developers who always have a take on the latest trend, either to quickly adopt or criticise it.
I really wanted to be a member of the Ruby crew for a time and ended up buying multiple copies of “Agile Web Development with Rails”, before having the opportunity to really apply it to a project and disposing of them because the material was outdated.</description>
