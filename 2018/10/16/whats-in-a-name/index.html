    <p>I usually get one of two looks when I announce the name of my company as <a href="https://niftydigits.com">&ldquo;Nifty Digits&rdquo;</a>. Either a “Ah, I like that” or a raised eyebrow. Generally, it’s the person latter in years who might raise an eyebrow.</p>
<p>When I picked the name, I was still a PhD student at University and wanted something that “sounded technical (digits), but also sort of British (nifty)”. I also was heavily influenced number of web design bloggers at the time, particularly Dan Cedarholm’s blog <a href="http://simplebits.com">“Simple Bits”</a>. I really liked the juxtaposition of simplicity and technical that name seemed to convey.</p>
<p>The other thing I liked was that it seemed it could be interpreted a number of different ways, lending itself to allowing me to be very versatile in terms of what I chose to work on. (I guess this is why I get the occasional raised eyebrow). This has allowed me to work on my own Fairtrade tshirt offshoot, tv/feature film pipelines and more traditional agile based software development.</p>
<p>Choosing a company name that wasn’t my own surname was deliberate - I’d seen various companies titled around a particular individual and that didn’t gel well with me. I would love my own little company to eventually become big enough to employ others, but naming it after myself seemed overly self-confident.</p>
<p>I didn’t register the company at first - just a domain, subsequently establishing it once finishing my job at Aardman animations.</p>
<p>I’ve now been working as Nifty Digits Ltd for over 6 years, which seems crazy and I hope to continue working as it for many more.</p>
