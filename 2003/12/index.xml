      <description>After having been working like theres no tomorrow on other coursework, I&amp;#8217;ve finally managed to come back to my project work.
I&amp;#8217;ve really not got very much productive work done on it aside from a few class diagrams and workflow routines which I&amp;#8217;ve put together. I have been working on a prototype over the last month however in order to have that side of things produced on time. Currently it doesn&amp;#8217;t do a lot more than add or delete users and needs to come a lot further before its something impressive which is worthy to be shown to my supervisor.</description>
