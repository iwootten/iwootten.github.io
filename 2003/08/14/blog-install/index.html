    <p>So, I’ve installed <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> on my website. I figured it was about time that I get up to speed on this whole “Blogging” thing, but I could of even missed the bus already.</p>
<p>I’ve spent half of the evening just looking at what can be done with MT, and it seems to integrate well with <a href="http://www.invisionboard.com/"> Invision Board</a> as the MT crew have an example of a forum set up with it on their site. On the other hand it could just be a good hack.</p>
<p>You might wonder why I’ve chosen MT over <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>. Basically its just aesthetics – I think that MT looks very pretty compared with Drupal, and it seems to be pretty well supported to boot.</p>
